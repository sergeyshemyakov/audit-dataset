###### AUDIT OVERVIEW 10


#### 2.5 PROjECT OVERVIEW

The protocol enables users to deposit assets publicly and withdraw them privately, provided
they can prove membership in an approved set of addresses. Each supported asset (native
or ERC20) has its own dedicated pool contract that inherits from a common `PrivacyPool`

implementation.


Deposit Flow


When a user deposits funds, they:



1.
2.
3.
4.
5.



Generate commitment parameters (nullifier and secret)
Send the deposit transaction through the Entrypoint
The Entrypoint routes the deposit to the appropriate pool
The pool records the commitment in its state tree
The depositor receives a deposit identifier (label) and a commitment hash



Withdrawal Flow


To withdraw funds privately, users:



1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.



Generate a zero-knowledge proof demonstrating:
Ownership of a valid deposit commitment
Membership in the approved address set
Correctness of the withdrawal amount
Submit the withdrawal transaction through a relayer
The pool verifies the proof and processes the withdrawal
A new commitment is created for the remaining funds (even if it is zero)



Pull Request Description


This pull request introduces changes to the to-be-upgraded `Entrypoint` contract. With this

upgrade, a `usedPrecommitments` mapping is added to the contract, which tracks all used

precommitments and prevents users from depositing using an already used
precommitment, thus preventing stuck funds.


Introduced changes:


state variable and checks added to Entrypoint
added unit tests for the new revert case
added an upgrade test using a forked environment from Ethereum Mainnet

###### AUDIT OVERVIEW 11


An issue of this kind could theoretically happen to the secrets used on withdrawals, though
it’s way less probable because of the nature of the commitment system on withdrawals:



1.


2.


3.



When withdrawing, partially or completely, a previous existing commitment is spent
and a new one is created for the remaining value (even if it’s zero). Because of this,
when generating the withdrawal proof, the user must provide the nullifier of the
spending commitment and a new nullifier for the new commitment. The

`withdraw.circom` <u>[circuit does take this in count](https://github.com/0xbow-io/privacy-pools-core/blob/6b38184fec2ad8d85a5adf0796d30d06426db124/packages/circuits/circuits/withdraw.circom#L94)</u> and will never produce a withdrawal
proof with a new commitment with the same nullifier as the just spent one.
The secrets for deposits and withdrawals are generated differently. Both are created
deterministically based on a `master_nullifier` and `master_secret`, but the data
[used as pre-image of the ultimate secret values is inherently different. For deposits,](https://github.com/0xbow-io/privacy-pools-core/blob/6b38184fec2ad8d85a5adf0796d30d06426db124/packages/sdk/src/core/account.service.ts#L241)
the secrets are image of `poseidon(master_key, pool_scope, deposit_index)`,
[while the ones of withdrawals](https://github.com/0xbow-io/privacy-pools-core/blob/6b38184fec2ad8d85a5adf0796d30d06426db124/packages/sdk/src/core/account.service.ts#L276) are the image of

`poseidon(master_key, deposit_label, withdrawal_index)` . This makes the
chances of collision of deposit and withdrawal secrets almost non-existent.
When withdrawing, since a commitment is spent, its nullifier is marked as spent and
that is checked for all further commitments to avoid double-spending. If a user were
to submit two partial withdrawals of the same origin deposit quickly with an outdated
state, one withdrawal transaction would be successful and the second one would
revert, as both withdrawals would be trying to spend the same commitment, which
can only be spent once.



This issue can not be used by a third actor in a malicious way whatsoever. Another account
can see the chain and use your same pre-commitment for a deposit, but only the user who
owns the master keys generated by the seed-phrase is the one that will be able to later
spend the commitment.

#### 2.7 CONCLUSION

A comprehensive audit was conducted on 2 contracts, revealing no critical and major issues.
However, several warnings and informational notes were identified. The audit identified
vulnerability with already used nullifier and code optimization.


Following our initial audit, Privacy Pools worked closely with our team to address the
identified issues. The proposed changes aim to strengthen protocol security, improve
efficiency, and ensure seamless user experience. Key recommendations include adding
validation checks, optimizing code, and ensuring compatibility between deposited and
withdrawn values to enhance security and maintain user privacy.
As a result, the project has passed our audit. Our auditors have verified that the Privacy
Pools Smart Contracts, as of audited commit
<u>`[238e3594053becde68aa40e1e4cef6c0c46e68da](https://github.com/0xbow-io/privacy-pools-core/commit/238e3594053becde68aa40e1e4cef6c0c46e68da)`</u>, operates as intended within the defined

scope, based on the information and code provided at the time of evaluation. The
robustness of the codebase has been significantly improved, meeting the necessary security
and functionality requirements established for this audit.

Potential nullifier reuse vulnerability in precommitment

tracking in `EntryPoint`

**File** **Location** **Line**


<u>[Entrypoint.sol](https://github.com/0xbow-io/privacy-pools-core/blob/238e3594053becde68aa40e1e4cef6c0c46e68da/packages/contracts/src/contracts/Entrypoint.sol#L317)</u> function `_handleDeposit` 317


Description


In the `_handleDeposit` function of the `EntryPoint` contract, a precommitment tracking

mechanism has been implemented:

```
  // Check if the `_precommitment` has already been used

  if (usedPrecommitments[_precommitment]) revert PrecommitmentAlreadyUsed();

  // Mark it as used

  usedPrecommitments[_precommitment] = true;

```

This implementation only partially mitigates precommitment reuse risk. The vulnerability
arises because a precommitment is computed as `hash(nullifier, secret)` . During

withdrawal, the system marks the nullifier as spent. However, an attacker could use the
same nullifier with different secrets to generate distinct precommitment hashes, effectively
bypassing the precommitment reuse check.


This vulnerability creates a scenario where multiple deposits could be made using the same
underlying nullifier, but only one could be successfully withdrawn (as the nullifier would be
marked spent after the first withdrawal). The remaining deposits would become
unwithdrawable, resulting in permanently locked funds.

###### fINDINgS REPORT 18


Recommendation


We recommend reconsidering the deposit logic to address the fundamental nullifier reuse
vulnerability. One possible solution is to implement a cryptographic mechanism to verify
nullifier uniqueness without revealing it at deposit time.


Update
Client's response


To use the same nullifier as other commitment, the attacker must have access to the user's
Privacy Pool seedphrase, which gives access to spending all user's commitments. On top of
it, nullifiers and secrets are generated based on a random key-pair and more pseudorandom values like pool scope and deposit label, making it impossible for a nullifier to be
generated twice accidentally. We won't take any action regarding this issue.

Description



contract `Entrypoint` - function `deposit` 113


contract `Entrypoint` - function `deposit` 125



In the function `_handleDeposit` of contract `Entrypoint`, a check for the presence of

`_precommitment` in the `usedPrecommitments` mapping was added. This function is invoked

when calling the `deposit` functions for both native and non-native assets.


However, the `_precommitment` check is performed after storage is read to verify the `_pool`

address:

```
  function _handleDeposit(IERC20 _asset, uint256 _value, uint256 _precommitment) internal

  returns (uint256 _commitment) {

  AssetConfig memory _config = assetConfig[_asset];

  IPrivacyPool _pool = _config.pool;

   if (address(_pool) == address(0)) revert PoolNotFound();

   if (usedPrecommitments[_precommitment]) revert PrecommitmentAlreadyUsed();

    // ...

```

and the asset transfer is executed in the `deposit` function:

```
  function deposit(

  IERC20 _asset,

###### fINDINgS REPORT 20

```

```
   uint256 _value,

   uint256 _precommitment

  ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 _commitment) {

  _asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _value);

  _commitment = _handleDeposit(_asset, _value, _precommitment);

  }

```

This leads to unnecessary gas consumption if the `_precommitment` already exists.


Recommendation


We recommend considering moving the `_precommitment` check to the very beginning of

the `deposit` function logic to optimize gas usage.


Update
Client's response


Will keep it as it is.

#### 4.1 SECURITY ASSESSMENT METhODOLOgY

Oxorio's smart contract security audit methodology is designed to ensure the security,
reliability, and compliance of curcuits throughout their development lifecycle. Our process
integrates the Smart Contract Security Verification Standard (SCSVS) with our advanced
techniques to address complex security challenges. For a detailed look at our approach,
please refer to the <u>[full version of our methodology.](https://docsend.com/view/yjpj6jggbqjpc5sa)</u> Here is a concise overview of our
auditing process:


**1. Project Architecture Review**


All necessary information about the smart contract is gathered, including its intended
functionality and dependencies. This stage sets the foundation by reviewing documentation,
business logic, and initial code analysis.


**2. Vulnerability Assessment**


This phase involves a deep dive into the smart contract's code to identify security
vulnerabilities. Rigorous testing and review processes are applied to ensure robustness
against potential attacks.


This stage is focused on identifying specific vulnerabilities within the smart contract code. It
involves scanning and testing the code for known security weaknesses and patterns that
could potentially be exploited by malicious actors.


**3. Security Model Evaluation**


The smart contract’s architecture is assessed to ensure it aligns with security best practices
and does not introduce potential vulnerabilities. This includes reviewing how the contract
integrates with external systems, its compliance with security best practices, and whether
the overall design supports a secure operational environment.


This phase involves a analysis of the project's documentation, the consistency of business
logic as documented versus implemented in the code, and any assumptions made during
the design and development phases. It assesses if the contract's architectural design
adequately addresses potential threats and integrates necessary security controls.


**4. Cross-Verification by Multiple Auditors**


Typically, the project is assessed by multiple auditors to ensure a diverse range of insights
and thorough coverage. Findings from individual auditors are cross-checked to verify
accuracy and completeness.


**5. Report Consolidation**

###### APPENDIX 23


Findings from all auditors are consolidated into a single, comprehensive express audit. This
report outlines potential vulnerabilities, areas for improvement, and an overall assessment
of the smart contract’s security posture.


**6. Reaudit of Revised Submissions**


Post-review modifications made by the client are reassessed to ensure that all previously
identified issues have been adequately addressed. This stage helps validate the
effectiveness of the fixes applied.


**7. Final express audit Publication**


The final version of the express audit is delivered to the client and published on Oxorio's
official website. This report includes detailed findings, recommendations for improvement,
and an executive summary of the smart contract’s security status.

###### APPENDIX 24

###### 4.2.1 Severity Level Reference

The following severity levels were assigned to the issues described in the report:


**Title** **Description**



**CRITICAL**


**MAJOR**


**WARNING**


**INFO**



Issues that pose immediate and significant risks, potentially leading to asset theft,
inaccessible funds, unauthorized transactions, or other substantial financial losses.
These vulnerabilities represent serious flaws that could be exploited to compromise
or control the entire contract. They require immediate attention and remediation to
secure the system and prevent further exploitation.


Issues that could cause a significant failure in the contract's functionality, potentially
necessitating manual intervention to modify or replace the contract. These
vulnerabilities may result in data corruption, malfunctioning logic, or prolonged
downtime, requiring substantial operational changes to restore normal performance.
While these issues do not immediately lead to financial losses, they compromise the
reliability and security of the contract, demanding prioritized attention and
remediation.


Issues that might disrupt the contract's intended logic, affecting its correct
functioning or making it vulnerable to Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These
problems may result in the unintended triggering of conditions, edge cases, or
interactions that could degrade the user experience or impede specific operations.
While they do not pose immediate critical risks, they could impact contract reliability
and require attention to prevent future vulnerabilities or disruptions.


Issues that do not impact the security of the project but are reported to the client's
team for improvement. They include recommendations related to code quality, gas
optimization, and other minor adjustments that could enhance the project's overall
performance and maintainability.
