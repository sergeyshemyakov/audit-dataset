**Version 1.0**


# **Review Summary**

The Auditware team has performed a security review on the 0xbow’s Privacy Pools
protocol’s Batch Relayer implementation for privacy pool batch withdrawal
functionality.

The scope consisted of the following contracts:

●​ **packages/contracts/src/contracts/BatchRelayer.sol**   - Main contract implementation
●​ **packages/contracts/src/interfaces/IBatchRelayer.sol**   - Interface definition
●​ **packages/contracts/script/BatchRelayer.s.sol**   - Deployment script

[Audit commit hash: 2f6a650](https://github.com/0xbow-io/privacy-pools-core/blob/2f6a650b4cbc7872e163a70c56cdc977fe7839b4)


Although best practices were applied and the contract was written with security in mind, several
issues were identified during the audit. Detailed explanations per item can be found in the
report.


As with all smart contracts, it is highly recommended to:


●​ Conduct regular and thorough audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
●​ Achieve the highest possible test coverage, ideally approaching 100%.
●​ Maintain comprehensive and up-to-date documentation.
●​ Participate in auditing contests and/or a bug bounty program.
●​ Implement on-chain monitoring for real-time threat detection and mitigation.

### Contracts Overview

The BatchRelayer contract enables atomic batch withdrawals from privacy pools,
allowing users to process multiple withdrawals in a single transaction while maintaining privacy
guarantees. The implementation follows a stateless architecture that accepts pool and
processor addresses as parameters, differing from the existing Entrypoint contract's
registry-based scope validation approach. The BatchRelayer only allows withdrawals,
simplifying the flows and validation requirements of the standard Entrypoint.

### Security Architecture

#### Core Security Controls:


●​ Reentrancy Protection: OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard prevents recursive calls during
batch processing
●​ Cryptographic Integrity: ZK proof verification with context binding prevents proof
manipulation
●​ Input Validation: Comprehensive validation of batch parameters, fee limits, and
withdrawal amounts
●​ Safe Asset Handling: OpenZeppelin SafeERC20 and proper native asset transfer patterns

#### Batch Processing Flow:


●​ Users generate ZK proofs binding withdrawals to specific processor and pool addresses
●​ BatchRelayer validates batch parameters and total value calculations
●​ Each withdrawal proof is verified against the bound processor context
●​ PrivacyPool contracts validate that the calling processor matches the proof-bound
processor
●​ Funds are transferred atomically with fee deduction and recipient distribution
●​ Architecture Comparison: Unlike Entrypoint's dual-layer validation (registry lookup +
processor self-validation), BatchRelayer relies on direct parameter passing with
validation primarily occurring in the PrivacyPool contracts through msg.sender checks.

## **Threat Model**

##### **Malicious pool substitution**

**Description:** Attackers could deploy pool contracts with identical interfaces but malicious logic.
Users may be tricked into generating proofs against them via phishing or compromised UIs.​
**Analysis:** Entrypoint contracts fetch pool addresses from an admin-controlled registry, ensuring
only pre-approved pools can be used. BatchRelayer allows arbitrary pool definitions, which could
expand the attack surface if a malicious pool definition were combined with UI compromise.​
**Risk:** High

##### **Malicious relayer / BatchRelayer substitution**


**Description:** A compromised or malicious relayer could substitute an attacker-controlled
BatchRelayer contract, enabling theft of withdrawn funds.​
**Analysis:** Relayer authenticity is not validated, consistent with Entrypoint design. Withdrawals
are integrity-protected by proofs, but without canonical relayer validation a malicious relayer
paired with a successful UI compromise could redirect withdrawn funds.​
**Risk:** High

##### **Relayer processing incomplete batches**


**Description:** Relayers could drop or skip some withdrawals to disrupt user batch withdrawal
amounts.​
**Analysis:** The contract enforces that the proof array size must equal the withdrawal count,
otherwise the call reverts. The context signal in proofs provides additional authenticity.​
**Risk:** Medium

##### **Entrypoint vs. BatchRelayer trust model divergence**


**Description:** Differences in validation logic between the two contracts could create gaps in
protection.​
**Analysis:** Entrypoint validates processors via pool-level checks, while BatchRelayer omits some
validation steps. Likely because user funds can only be deposited to authentic pools via the
Entrypoint, mitigating the effective risk of a malicious BatchRelayer pool usage. This divergence
means the two contracts rely on different assumptions, which could result in differing logic


Page 4


flows between the two contracts.​
**Risk:** Medium

##### **BatchRelayData overflow into totalValue**


**Description:** Possibility that a large batchSize could overflow into totalValue and alter
withdrawal amounts.​
**Analysis:** Overflow is potentially theoretically possible, but would only invalidate the proof and
cause a revert. totalValue is not used for calculations beyond a consistency check, so
practical impact is minimal.​
**Risk:** Low

##### **Relayer denial-of-service**


**Description:** Malicious relayers could refuse to process transactions or censor withdrawals.​
**Analysis:** This risk exists but is consistent with current design assumptions. No additional code
paths beyond Entrypoint were found that increase exposure.​
**Risk:** Low

## **AW-H-01: Unrestricted Processor Address** **Acceptance**

**Severity:** _<mark>High</mark>_ **<mark>​</mark>** **​** **​** **​** **​** **​** **​** **​** **​** **Status:** _<mark>Unmitigated</mark>_


**Code:**


●​ <u>[packages/contracts/src/contracts/BatchRelayer.sol#L26](https://github.com/0xbow-io/privacy-pools-core/blob/2f6a650b4cbc7872e163a70c56cdc977fe7839b4/packages/contracts/src/contracts/BatchRelayer.sol#L26)</u>


**Description:**


During the audit it was found that users can be socially engineered into generating proofs with


malicious processor addresses, and the protocol has no way to distinguish between legitimate


and malicious processors.


The current validation in PrivacyPool.sol:
```
// Check caller is the allowed processooor
if (msg.sender != _withdrawal.processooor) revert
InvalidProcessooor();

// Check the context matches to ensure its integrity
if (_proof.context() !=
uint256(keccak256(abi.encode(_withdrawal, SCOPE))) %
Constants.SNARK_SCALAR_FIELD) {
 revert ContextMismatch();
}

```

This only ensures that:


●​ The caller matches the processor specified in the withdrawal


●​ The proof was generated for this specific withdrawal data


But still enables attackers to deploy malicious processors with identical interfaces and steal all


withdrawn funds.


The attack requires minimal technical sophistication only contract deployment and social


engineering with no gas costs or technical barriers once users are deceived.


Page 7


An attacker abusing this scenario might follow these steps:


●​ Attacker deploys malicious BatchRelayer contract with identical interface


●​ Through compromised UI, social engineering, or phishing, tricks user into generating


withdrawal proofs on a valid pool with malicious processor address


●​ User unknowingly authorizes withdrawal to attacker's contract instead of legitimate


BatchRelayer


●​ Malicious contract receives all withdrawn funds and redirects them to attacker instead of


intended recipient


●​ Attack scales if malicious processor address spreads through compromised UIs or


documentation


**Recommendations:**


●​ Processor Whitelist: Add a whitelist of approved processor addresses at the PrivacyPool


level


●​ Circuit-Level Validation: Include processor address validation within the zero-knowledge


circuit itself


●​ Registry Pattern: Implement a canonical processor registry that users/UIs can reference

## **AW-M-01: Unvalidated Pool Parameter**

**Severity:** _<mark>Medium</mark>_ **<mark>​</mark>** **​** **​** **​** **​** **​** **​** **​** **Status:** _<mark>Unmitigated</mark>_


**Code:**


●​ <u>[packages/contracts/src/contracts/BatchRelayer.sol#L27](https://github.com/0xbow-io/privacy-pools-core/blob/2f6a650b4cbc7872e163a70c56cdc977fe7839b4/packages/contracts/src/contracts/BatchRelayer.sol#L27)</u>


**Description:**


BatchRelayer accepts any pool address as a parameter without validation, contrasting with


Entrypoint's registry-based approach that provides cryptographic assurance of pool legitimacy.


This architectural difference creates conditional fund loss scenarios where users interact with


unverified pools:

```
// Entrypoint validates pools via registry:
IPrivacyPool _pool = scopeToPool[_scope];
if (address(_pool) == address(0)) revert PoolNotFound();

// BatchRela yer accepts any pool address directly

```

The risk manifests when attackers deploy malicious pool contracts implementing IPrivacyPool


interfaces with dishonest logic. Unlike Entrypoint's technical enforcement through registry


validation, BatchRelayer relies entirely on user behavior and UI integrity for pool verification,


creating a trust gap that sophisticated attackers can exploit through social engineering


campaigns or compromised UIs.


An attacker may abuse this by following the next scenario:


●​ Attacker deploys malicious pool contract implementing **IPrivacyPool** interface with


malicious logic


●​ Through social engineering, phishing sites, or compromised documentation, tricks users


into believing malicious pool is legitimate


●​ User generates a withdrawal proof against the malicious pool


●​ User receives fake ERC-20 tokens that they would assume are legitimate.


●​ Unlike Entrypoint's registry protection, BatchRelayer provides no technical barrier to


prevent interaction with malicious pools


Page 9


**Recommendations:**


●​ Implement comprehensive pool validation. You may follow one of these suggestions:


○​ Integrating with Entrypoint's existing pool registry to validate **_pool** addresses


against **scopeToPool** mapping


○​ Creating a dedicated pool registry with administrative controls for adding verified


pools. As an interim measure, clearly document pool verification requirements in


user-facing interfaces and provide canonical pool addresses through official


channels to reduce social engineering attack surface.

## **AW-L-01: Missing Constructor Parameter** **Validation**

**Severity:** _<mark>Low</mark>_ **<mark>​</mark>** **​** **​** **​** **​** **​** **​** **​** **​** **Status:** _<mark>Unmitigated</mark>_


**Code:**


●​ <u>[packages/contracts/src/contracts/BatchRelayer.sol#L19](https://github.com/0xbow-io/privacy-pools-core/blob/2f6a650b4cbc7872e163a70c56cdc977fe7839b4/packages/contracts/src/contracts/BatchRelayer.sol#L19)</u>


**Description:**


The BatchRelayer constructor accepts any value for **MAX_RELAY_FEE_BPS** without bounds


validation, creating deployment-time configuration risk.

```
constructor(uint256 _maxRelayFeeBPS) {

MAX_RELAY_FEE_BPS = _maxRelayFeeBPS;

}

```

While the current deployment script correctly sets 1000 (10%), the lack of validation could


theoretically allow deployment with fees exceeding 100%.


This creates operational risk if deployment scripts are modified incorrectly or if the contract is


deployed manually without proper parameter verification. This can pose a risk of future


deployments could inadvertently create unusable contracts with impossible fee structures.


**Recommendations:**


●​ Add comprehensive constructor validation to prevent misconfiguration:

```
   constructor(uint256 _maxRelayFeeBPS) {
     require(_maxRelayFeeBPS <= 10_000, "Fee exceeds 100%");
     require(_maxRelayFeeBPS > 0, "Fee must be positive");
   MAX_RELAY_FEE_BPS = _maxRelayFeeBPS;
   }

```

This ensures deployment-time parameter validation and provides clear error messages


for misconfiguration attempts.

## **AW-L-02: Batch Size Type Limitation**

**Severity:** _<mark>Low</mark>_ **<mark>​</mark>** **​** **​** **​** **​** **​** **​** **​** **​** **Status:** _<mark>Unmitigated</mark>_


**Code:**


●​ <u>[packages/contracts/src/interfaces/IBatchRelayer.sol#L24](https://github.com/0xbow-io/privacy-pools-core/blob/2f6a650b4cbc7872e163a70c56cdc977fe7839b4/packages/contracts/src/interfaces/IBatchRelayer.sol#L24)</u>


**Description:**


During the audit, it was found that the **BatchRelayData** struct uses **uint8** for batch size, which


limits batch operations to a maximum of 255 withdrawals:

```
struct BatchRelayData {
  // ...
  uint8 batchSize;  // Maximum 255 batches
  uint256 totalValue;
}

```

This type constraint prevents processing larger batch operations that might be required by


power users, institutional withdrawals, or automated systems processing high volumes.


While not a direct security risk, the limitation could impact user experience and protocol


adoption for large-scale operations. Users requiring >255 withdrawals must execute multiple


batch transactions.


**Recommendations:**


●​ Consider **uint16** for batch size if larger batches are anticipated, or document the


255-withdrawal limit.
