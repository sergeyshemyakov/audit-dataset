#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of a series of changes to the BoLD
contract and the DAC Rewards contract. These changes include fixes for previous security
assessments as well as code quality improvements. The DAC Reward also was modified to
support distribution on rewards on the Optimism rollups.


A team of two consultants conducted the review from June 10 to June 20, 2024, for a total
of three engineer-weeks of effort. Our testing efforts focused on a selected list of PRs
provided by Offchain Labs. With full access to source code and documentation, we
performed a manual process to review the code changes as well as some limited mutation
testing to assess the quality of the unit tests.

#### Observations and Impact

We spent the majority of our time on the BOLD changes, checking whether any of them
would allow a malicious party to win a challenge by confirmation or prevent an honest
party from winning challenges (e.g., by making it impossible for an honest party to continue
participating in a challenge). We also checked for possible misconfiguration of the new
parameters and features. We reviewed changes to the staking pool contracts to assess
whether a malicious user could steal tokens or withdraw their tokens before a challenge is
finished.


We did not uncover any serious issues in the implementation. However, we found one
issue in the DAC Reward code due to a gas optimization that would make the transaction
revert for certain ERC20 tokens (TOB-DACR-1).

#### Recommendations

Based on the codebase maturity evaluation and findings identified during the security
review, Trail of Bits recommends that Offchain Labs take the following steps:


  - Remediate the findings uncovered during this review.


  - Improve the quality of the tests and add mutation testing to the software
development lifecycle to improve the quality of the testing suite (see appendix B).

## Project Goals

The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of the Offchain’s BoLD and
DAC Rewards contracts. Specifically, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list
of questions:


  - Are the fixes for issues identified in previous security audits sufficient?


  - Have the code changes introduced any security or correctness issues?

## Project Coverage

This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by
our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following PRs:


  - [#609 adds an event to track timer cache updates.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/609)


  - [#623 removes](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/623) `EdgeConfirmedByChildren` and `EdgeConfirmedByClaim` events,
since they are unused with bottom-up timers.


  - [#627 introduces a feature to pin a withdrawal address on creating a new stake](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/627)
(similar to how beacon chain withdrawal credential works), thus reducing the risk of
having a hot private key in the validator software.


  - [#631 fixes a mainly cosmetic error where attempts to confirm an already-confirmed](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/631)
edge by time revert with `RivalEdgeConfirmed` . This PR makes the attempt revert
with `EdgeNotPending` instead.


  - [#617 merges the delay buffer feature that was previously audited.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/617)


  - [#637 and #641 introduce an optimization when a stake is slashed: since the loser](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/637)
stake escrow may not be able to call `withdraw`, the confiscated stake is sent directly
to the winner instead of adding to its withdrawable amount.


  - [#639 changes the documentation of the](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/639) `firstRival` function.


  - [#619 introduces a new staking pool similar to the existing assertion staking pool.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/619)


  - [#628 merges changes from Stylus.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/628)


  - [#643 changes](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/643) `ChallengeManager` contract to inherit the allowlist from the `Rollup`
contract, and imposes a limit to ensure that each validator can create only one root
edge per sub-challenge.


  - [#645 removes the old challenge manager.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/645)


  - [#642 introduces several changes:](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/642)


    - The bold upgrade action contract has been modified to update the
sequencer inbox with the delay buffer feature.


    - The action contract also upgrades the inbox to deprecate methods that
assume that `tx.origin` `==` `msg.sender` implies the use of EOA sender.
This upgrade preempts breaking changes caused by future Ethereum hard
forks.

    - This PR also changes the `BOLDUpgradeAction` to persist the `Bridge`,
`Outbox`, and `RollupEventInbox` upgrades.


  - [#6 in the bold private repository adds the beta parameters described in the section](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold-private/pull/6)
4.8.1 of the bold paper.


  - [#8 in the bold private repository applies the same fix as #631 but is confirmed by](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold-private/pull/8)
the OSP.


  - [#652 enforces that the](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/652) `delayBlock` parameter is consistent with `delaySeconds` to
ensure that the force inclusion window does not inadvertently decrease.


  - [#655 addresses the issue #8 found in the C4 bug contest. It is a short-term](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/655)
workaround that prevents the admin from reducing the assertion base stake
amount.


  - [#654 addresses the issue #5 found in the C4 bug contest.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/654)


  - [#651 adds more descriptive events to the sequencer inbox and rollup contracts.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/651)


  - [#650 uses OpenZeppelin’s enumerable set for the validator allowlist. This makes it](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/650)
easier to retrieve the list of validators off-chain.


  - [#653 introduces the following changes to the staking and withdrawal flow to make it](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/653)
easier and safer for validators to handle funds:


    - Adds a new `returnOldDepositFor` function, allowing the withdrawal
address to trigger withdrawals.


    - Adds a new `newStake` function, allowing validators to become staked with
any amount (even 0).


  - [#659 addresses the issue #2 in the C4 bug contest.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/659)


  - [#664 forbids a pool to be created with an empty edge id or assertion hash.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/664)


  - [#665 allows configuration of](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/665) `validatorAfkBlocks`, with the option to set it to 0 to
disable this feature entirely.


  - [#29 in the fund distribution repository allows reward distribution in Optimism](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts/pull/29)
chains.


We reviewed this code looking for usual flaws in Solidity code as well as any issues that
would allow a malicious party to win a challenge by confirmation or prevent an honest
party from winning challenges (e.g., by making it impossible for an honest party to continue
participating in a challenge). We also checked for possible misconfiguration of the new
parameters and features. We reviewed the staking pool contracts changes to check

whether it is possible to steal tokens and whether a malicious user can withdraw their
tokens before the challenge is finished.

#### Coverage Limitations

Because of the time-boxed nature of testing work, it is common to encounter coverage
limitations. The following list outlines the coverage limitations of the engagement and
indicates system elements that may warrant further review:


  - We have not reviewed in detail how the BoLD codebase evolved. Instead, we used
the diff/PRs provided by Offchain Labs to bound the scope of this assessment.

**ID** **Title** **Type** **Severity**



1 routeToken function may fail for certain ERC20
tokens



Undefined
Behavior



**Medium**



Trail of Bits 12 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


## Detailed Findings

1. routeToken function may fail for certain ERC20 tokens


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-DACR-1


Target: `src/FeeRouter/ArbChildToParentRewardRouter.sol`,
`src/FeeRouter/OpChildToParentRewardRouter.sol`,
```
 src/FeeRouter/ParentToChildRewardRouter.sol

```

Description
The `routeToken` function can revert for ERC20 tokens that require the allowance to be set
to 0 when calling the `approve` function, such as USDT.


The function has an optimization where it approves `amount` `+` `1` to the gateway, which will
transfer the amount of tokens in a following call. The idea is to never change the allowance
storage slot from a non-zero to a zero value and saving gas. However, tokens such as USDT
require the current allowance to be 0 when a user calls the `approve` function; in this case,
this makes the `routeToken` function revert.

```
 function routeToken(address parentChainTokenAddr, uint256 maxSubmissionCost, uint256
 gasLimit, uint256 maxFeePerGas)
    public
    payable
 {
    ...
    // approve amount on gateway, adding 1 so storage slot doesn't get set to 0,
 saving gas.
    IERC20(parentChainTokenAddr).approve(gateway, amount + 1);

    ...
 }
```

_[(src/FeeRouter/ParentToChildRewardRouter.sol#L162-L163)](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts/blob/b390734d934e6d8b05b78e5ef38739c4b8e668b6/src/FeeRouter/ParentToChildRewardRouter.sol#L162-L163)_


Exploit Scenario
The `ParentToChildRewardRouter` contract is deployed with `parentChainTokenAddr`
set to the USDT address. A user calls the `routeToken` function, but it unexpectedly reverts.


Trail of Bits 13 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


Recommendations
Short term, remove this optimization or use the `[forceApprove](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/442886ed5ff8a0b9ab477b191f5238541ee6d772/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L76-L83)` function in the `SafeERC20`
library after verifying that this function would still save gas.


Long term, when developing a contract that interacts with ERC20 tokens, consider all
possible different implementations and which implementations your contract should
support.

## B. Mutation Testing

During our review, we ran two mutation testing tools, Necessist and `slither-mutate`, to
identify potential shortcomings in the test suite and implementation.


[To use Necessist, run the following command:](https://github.com/trailofbits/necessist)

```
   necessist --framework foundry
   test/challengeV2/EdgeChallengeManager.t.sol

```

To use `[slither-mutate](https://github.com/crytic/slither/blob/master/slither/tools/mutator/README.md)`, run the following command:

```
   slither-mutate src/challengeV2/EdgeChallengeManager.sol
   --test-cmd='forge test'

```

The same commands can be used for other contracts.


[Note that due to a Solidity issue regarding unicode characters #14733,](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14733) `slither-mutate`
will use an incorrect source mapping for the mutation; as a result, any unicode characters
should be removed. The `EdgeChallengeManager.sol` includes the unicode characters β
and ∗ [in the comments on lines 86, 94, and 103.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/6b42a38fc28f9b6a7864001fe797b9f07dad6357/contracts/src/challengeV2/EdgeChallengeManager.sol#L86)


We tested the following contracts:




- Necessist




   - ChallengeEdgeLib.t.sol

   - EdgeChallengeManager.t.sol

   - EdgeChallengeManagerLib.t.sol

   - Rollup.t.sol

- Slither-mutate




- AssertionStakingPool.sol

- EdgeChallengeManager.sol

- EdgeChallengeManagerLib.sol

- RollupCore.sol

- RollupUserLogic.sol

- RollupAdminLogic.sol



After reviewing the results, we identified missing test coverage for the cases described in
the following sections.


**1. Timer cache is never tested for a cache hit**
The `updateTimerCache` function is never tested for a cache hit in the highlighted line.

```
 function updateTimerCache(EdgeStore storage store, bytes32 edgeId, uint256 newValue,

```

Trail of Bits 17 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


```
uint256 maximumCachedTime)

```

```
  internal
  returns (bool, uint256)
{

```

```
  uint256 currentAccuTimer = validateCurrentTimer(store, edgeId,
maximumCachedTime);

```

```
  newValue = newValue > type(uint64).max ? type(uint64).max : newValue;
  // only update when increased
  if (newValue > currentAccuTimer) {
     store.edges[edgeId].totalTimeUnrivaledCache = uint64(newValue);
     return (true, newValue);
  }
  return (false, currentAccuTimer);
}

```


_Figure B.1: The_ _`updateTimerCache`_ _function_
_(_ _`[src/challengeV2/libraries/EdgeChallengeManagerLib.sol#L516-L528](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/6b42a38fc28f9b6a7864001fe797b9f07dad6357/contracts/src/challengeV2/libraries/EdgeChallengeManagerLib.sol#L516-L528)`_ _)_


Additionally, the branch where `newValue` `>` `type(uint64).max` is never tested.


**2. Failure to check returned value of current timer**
Related to the previous finding, the `updateTimerCache` function is not properly tested, as
the current timer can be reduced to zero without producing any failure in the tests:

```
 function validateCurrentTimer(EdgeStore storage store, bytes32 edgeId, uint256
 maximumCachedTime)
   internal
   view
   returns (uint256)
 {
   uint256 currentAccuTimer = store.edges[edgeId].totalTimeUnrivaledCache;
   if (currentAccuTimer >= maximumCachedTime) {
     revert CachedTimeSufficient(currentAccuTimer, maximumCachedTime);
   }
   return currentAccuTimer;
 }
```

_Figure B.2: The_ _`validateCurrentTimer`_ _function_
_(_ _`[src/challengeV2/libraries/EdgeChallengeManagerLib.sol#L500-L510](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/6b42a38fc28f9b6a7864001fe797b9f07dad6357/contracts/src/challengeV2/libraries/EdgeChallengeManagerLib.sol#L500-L510)`_ _)_


This function is called in other contexts, but the returned value is never checked in those
cases.


**3. Total unrivaled time is always zero in the tests**
In the context of the tests, the `timeUnrivaled` function always returns zero:

```
 function updateTimerCacheByClaim(
   EdgeStore storage store,
   bytes32 edgeId,
   bytes32 claimingEdgeId,

```

Trail of Bits 18 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


```
   uint8 numBigStepLevel,
   uint256 maximumCachedTime
 ) internal returns (bool, uint256) {
   // calculate the time unrivaled without inheritance
   uint256 totalTimeUnrivaled = timeUnrivaled(store, edgeId);
   checkClaimIdLink(store, edgeId, claimingEdgeId, numBigStepLevel);
   totalTimeUnrivaled += store.edges[claimingEdgeId].totalTimeUnrivaledCache;
   return updateTimerCache(store, edgeId, totalTimeUnrivaled, maximumCachedTime);
 }
```

4. **Overflow assertions are never tested**
There is a gap in the testing of overflow assertions, which affects important sections of the
`createNewAssertion` function:

```
 function createNewAssertion(
   AssertionInputs calldata assertion,
   bytes32 prevAssertionHash,
   bytes32 expectedAssertionHash
 ) internal returns (bytes32 newAssertionHash, bool overflowAssertion) {
     ...
     if (assertion.afterState.machineStatus != MachineStatus.ERRORED &&
 afterStateCmpMaxInbox < 0) {
        // If we didn't reach the target next inbox position, this is an
 overflow assertion.
        overflowAssertion = true;
        // This shouldn't be necessary, but might as well constrain the
 assertion to be non-empty
        require(afterGS.comparePositions(beforeGS) > 0, "OVERFLOW_STANDSTILL");
     }
     ...
```

_Figure B.4: Snippet of the_ _`createNewAssertion`_ _function_

_(_ _`[src/rollup/RollupCore.sol#L378-L531](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/6b42a38fc28f9b6a7864001fe797b9f07dad6357/contracts/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol#L378-L531)`_ _)_


4. **Edge staking fuzz test missing precondition**
The `testProperInitialization` fuzz test is missing a precondition that sometimes
causes it to fail. The new code requires that the assertion is not zero.

```
 function testProperInitialization(bytes32 edgeId) public {
   IEdgeStakingPool stakingPool =
 stakingPoolCreator.createPool(address(challengeManager), edgeId);

   assertEq(address(stakingPoolCreator.getPool(address(challengeManager), edgeId)),
 address(stakingPool));

   assertEq(address(stakingPool.challengeManager()), address(challengeManager));
   assertEq(stakingPool.edgeId(), edgeId);

```

Trail of Bits 19 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


```
   assertEq(address(stakingPool.stakeToken()), address(token));
 }
```

_Figure B.5: The_ _`testProperInitialization`_ _function_
_(_ _`[test/stakingPool/EdgeStakingPool.t.sol#L44-L52](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/6b42a38fc28f9b6a7864001fe797b9f07dad6357/contracts/test/stakingPool/EdgeStakingPool.t.sol#L44-L52)`_ _)_


If the `edgeId` is zero, then the code will revert in the pool creation:


```
constructor(

```

```
  address _challengeManager,
  bytes32 _edgeId
) AbsBoldStakingPool(address(EdgeChallengeManager(_challengeManager).stakeToken()))
{

```

```
if (_edgeId == bytes32(0)) {

```

```
     revert EmptyEdgeId();
  }
  challengeManager = _challengeManager;
  edgeId = _edgeId;
}

```

5. **The** **`makeStakeWithdrawableAndWithdrawBackIntoPool`** **function is never tested**
The `makeStakeWithdrawableAndWithdrawBackIntoPool` function of the
`AssertionStakingPool` contract is never tested.


**6. confirmEdgeByTime corner case is never tested**
The case where the total time unrivaled is less than the confirmation threshold blocks is
never reached and needs an additional unit test.


```
function confirmEdgeByTime(

```

```
  EdgeStore storage store,
  bytes32 edgeId,
  uint64 claimedAssertionUnrivaledBlocks,
  uint64 confirmationThresholdBlock
) internal returns (uint256) {

```

```
if (!store.edges[edgeId].exists()) {

```

```
  revert EdgeNotExists(edgeId);
}
