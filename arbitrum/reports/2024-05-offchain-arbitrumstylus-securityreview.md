#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

Trail of Bits 6 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of Stylus. Stylus is an upgrade to
Arbitrum Nitro that enables a new way to write smart contracts by introducing a second,
coequal virtual machine (VM) that is fully interoperable with the EVM.


A team of six consultants conducted the review from October 30, 2023, to May 3, 2024, for
a total of 47 engineer-weeks of effort. Our testing efforts focused on the Stylus VM and its
associated smart contracts. With full access to source code and documentation, we
performed static and dynamic testing of the Stylus codebase, using automated and manual
processes. A detailed description of the scoping per component is provided in the Project
Coverage section.

#### Observations and Impact

The Stylus audit revealed a number of issues, mostly of low and informational severity,
related to WASM program activation/handling/processing (e.g., TOB-STYLUS-1), EVM
compatibility (e.g., TOB-STYLUS-15), and cache handling (TOB-STYLUS-34). In general, we
found the code to be very robust, with a small number of corner-case but low-impact bugs.
However, we must state that the complexity of the code is very high, and it would have
been extremely difficult to review without the accompanying documentation, code
walkthroughs, and constant communication with the client.

#### Recommendations

Based on the codebase maturity evaluation and findings identified during the security
review, Trail of Bits recommends that Offchain Labs take the following steps:


  - **Remediate the findings disclosed in this report.** These findings should be
addressed as part of a direct remediation or as part of any refactor that may occur
when addressing other recommendations.


  - **Expand the unit, end-to-end, and random testing.** The codebase needs to be
extensively tested with traditional unit tests and smart fuzzing in order to detect
unreliable code and potential points of failure. Appendix F and appendix G provide
concrete recommendations.

## Project Goals

The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of Arbitrum Stylus.
Specifically, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list of questions:


  - Are WASM programs deterministic after instrumentation?


  - Do instrumented WASM programs terminate in a finite number of steps?


  - Is there a risk of denial of service?


  - Can instrumented WASM programs overflow the host stack?


  - Does the middleware accurately track the gas used by user programs?


  - Are there differences between the native, JIT, and prover execution modes?


  - Are there reachable panics that could cause the node to crash?


  - Do the host I/O implementations for the native and prover execution modes diverge
in any way?


  - Could the use of unsafe Rust and the FFI result in undefined behavior?


  - Can users cause excess resource consumption without incurring costs?


  - Can error guards be popped outside of user WASM code?


  - Are all provided premachine states correctly validated in the one-step prover?


  - Is serialization for the one-step prover done correctly?


  - Is the price for activating programs applied correctly?


  - Is it possible to bypass program expirations to execute programs after they should
have expired?


  - Does the activation pricing formula produce the intended price?


  - Are there any potential denial-of-service vectors due to mispricing?

## Project Coverage

This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by
our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:


**●** **Stylus VM:** Stylus introduces the ability to deploy WASM programs that are
executed in a second virtual machine that works alongside the existing EVM. Stylus
programs use “ink” (a form of gas), which limits their execution and prevents denial
of service. During the engagement, we reviewed the implementation of the different
Stylus opcodes, the way ink is charged to Stylus programs, and the behavior of the
VM when a program errors out, panics, or runs out of ink.


**●** **Activation:** WASM programs were not created to run on blockchains, so they lack
key features such as gas metering and come with certain operations that should not
be allowed on distributed networks. To include gas metering and to ensure that
these programs can be safely executed by the network, Stylus programs need to be
instrumented (i.e., they need to be parsed to insert gas-metering operations and to
validate that they work within the network’s rules). This expensive instrumentation
and compilation process is called “activation,” and it produces WASM programs that
can be executed by the network. During our review, we covered the activation
process to ensure that gas metering is applied properly, that limitations on user
WASM binaries are applied, and that the activation gas cost is charged
appropriately; we also checked for different denial-of-service scenarios.


**●** **Execution modes:** Stylus provides three different execution modes for validators:
native, JIT, and prover.


    - Native execution mode uses WASM binaries that are compiled into x86/ARM
native code to run them at full speed.


    - In prover mode, users run the same WAVM execution inside the Stylus VM in
order to resolve fraud proof challenges. It is the slowest mode, but it offers
the highest security guarantees of the three.


    - JIT execution is an intermediate execution mode between native and prover,
in which users run the same WASM binaries they would run in native
execution mode. It offers higher security guarantees than native execution.


    - Each mode has a different code path inside Stylus and requires user
programs to be compiled in different ways. We looked for any divergences in
behavior between the modes and looked for corner cases related to the
nuances of each mode (e.g., whether a thread could time out in JIT mode).
We also verified that user Stylus programs cannot interfere with the main


Trail of Bits 12 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


thread, which performs important operations such as starting user programs
and verifying return codes.


**●** **Fraud proof system:** All the Arbitrum L2 transactions are executed by validators
and can be challenged by any user who believes the validators are not honest.
During a challenge, the entire block is re-executed in order to determine whether
the state is valid and to resolve the challenge, and a proof of the final state is
provided. We reviewed the following components of the fraud proof system:


   - Arbitrator: The Arbitrator is a Rust implementation of the Stylus VM that runs
when there is a challenge (i.e., it is meant to be run by validators).


   - One Step Proof (OSP): The OSP is a collection of Solidity smart contracts that
allow users to emulate a single instruction on Ethereum to prove its
execution. It is the lowest level of granularity a challenge can reach.


   - Program linking component: During the execution of fraud proof verification,
instead of bisecting the vanilla replay machine’s execution of a block,
validators bisect execution of user programs, which are dynamically linked in
and out over the course of execution, to fraud proof them directly.


During the review, we looked for any correctness issues in the Arbitrator, such as
those that could cause the Arbitrator to force a prover to validate an incorrect state
or prevent a prover from validating a correct state. Since part of the fraud proof
system is performed on-chain, we looked for Solidity/EVM-related issues and
practical limitations that could block the use of the OSP during challenges (e.g.,
issues that could cause consumption of excessive gas).


- **Host I/O operations:** When a Stylus contract needs to access EVM state, or perform
other operations that are not possible in pure WASM, it needs to use the host I/O
operations from the Stylus VM for interacting with the contract’s environment.


During the review, we looked for any possible discrepancies between the
implementations of host I/O operations in the three execution modes, ensured that
host I/O operations are properly priced, and looked for issues that could cause
invalid or incorrect data that would impact such operations (e.g., address overflows,
dangling pointers, etc.).


- **The memory model:** Stylus introduces a novel VM for which no deployed contracts
currently exist. This provided the Stylus developers an opportunity to fix the
mistakes of the EVM related to memory; the main difference between Stylus’s
memory model and the EVM is that memory pricing is global instead of “per call
stack.”


Trail of Bits 13 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


During the review, we checked whether the memory model is applied properly and
looked for edge cases in the new design such as interactions between both models
(EVM and Stylus) in the same transaction.


- **Error guards:** At the start of the review, a feature called “error guards” existed.
These guards were inserted into user WASM programs during the proving process
to allow the proving system to recover from user program errors.


Later during the review, this feature was removed and reintroduced in a different
form with the use of co-threads; co-threads that error out can reenter the main
thread at a preestablished program counter. We reviewed the implementation to
ensure that it works as intended.


- **Stylus messages, WASI, and co-threads:** [WASI allows the Go compiler to target](https://go.dev/blog/wasi)
WASM binaries through a standardized API. WASI replaced the previous JavaScript
environment in Stylus.


Because the Go compiler does not support exports, it is not possible for WASM to
call back into Go, which is necessary for Stylus programs to execute host I/O
operations. (Note that this is only for the JIT and prover execution modes.) To get
around this limitation, the Stylus VM uses threads (for JIT execution) and co-threads
(for prover execution).


The basic idea of co-threads is that only a single thread is ever running at a given
time (i.e., there is no parallelization), and that thread is executing either the “main
thread” or a Stylus program (each call to a Stylus program will create a new thread).
Whenever a Stylus program wants to perform a host I/O operation, it has to return a
request ID and halt its execution; this request is then picked up by the main thread,
which sends the response back to the Stylus program thread and the program
resumes execution until it ends.


The implementation of co-threads differs between the JIT and prover execution
modes, but the basic idea is the same. The main difference is that in the JIT
execution mode, actual system threads are spawned, and the main thread and the
threads executing Stylus programs communicate using synchronous channels; on
the other hand, in the prover execution mode, there is only a single thread, but each
time a Stylus program is called, the user program is linked to the Arbitrator machine
(i.e., becomes part of the machine state) and a new value stack and frame stack are
created.


We checked whether co-threads are correctly implemented and considered
scenarios such as the ones below to look for corner cases:


   - What happens if a Stylus program calls itself?


Trail of Bits 14 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


    - What happens when `delegatecall` is used?


    - What happens if a Stylus upgrade is made while a Stylus program is linked (is
running in a co-thread)?


    - How do co-threads react to errors and panics?


    - Can a Stylus program or the main thread hang?


    - Is there a way to force a channel to time out in JIT mode?


    - Is the computational cost of using channels properly accounted for?


Finally, we checked whether the differences between the native, JIT, and prover
execution implementations result in discrepancies in their execution.

#### Coverage Limitations

Because of the time-boxed nature of testing work, it is common to encounter coverage
limitations. The following list outlines the coverage limitations of the engagement and
indicates system elements that may warrant further review:


  - [Most of the WASM code, except the specific Offchain modifications, was out of](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/wasmer/commits/061b594dfc8eaa336b2840dbdc3f83ceac4ed5e0/)
scope.


  - We assumed that the Go and Rust compiler WASM generation code is correct.


  - We did not verify that native execution mode behaves the same for x86 and ARM.
We performed only some fuzzing testing, mainly on x86. In order to ensure this
property, a large differential fuzzing campaign should be performed.


  - The Stylus SDK was out of scope.

## Codebase Maturity Evaluation

Trail of Bits uses a traffic-light protocol to provide each client with a clear understanding of
the areas in which its codebase is mature, immature, or underdeveloped. Deficiencies
identified here often stem from root causes within the software development life cycle that
should be addressed through standardization measures (e.g., the use of common libraries,
functions, or frameworks) or training and awareness programs.


**Category** **Summary** **Result**



Arithmetic While Stylus is not, generally speaking, an
arithmetic-heavy codebase, it still contains critical code
that uses mathematical operations, such as pointer
arithmetic in the host I/O operations and the memory
model. All arithmetic operations we observed use
saturating math, but they are not always implemented
consistently between the execution modes, which could
result in high-severity issues if the code fails to behave in
the same way. Additionally, not all expected properties
and corner cases are properly documented, and the
relevant code is not extensively fuzz tested to ensure it is
robust.


Auditing Our review of the system’s smart contracts was very
limited in this audit. Despite our limited review, we found
that events are emitted for all relevant on-chain
contracts; additionally, there are several instances of
logging and debugging options in the off-chain
components.



Authentication /
Access Controls


Complexity
Management



Most of the Stylus components define permissionless
features allowing users to activate or run any program as
long as it is valid. These features do, however, introduce
a number of chain parameters. These parameters are
correctly handled in the ArbOS state configuration, which
is accessible only to the chain owner.


In its current state, the complexity of the Stylus codebase
is high. Some of this complexity is inherent to the
software stack used (i.e., because it has to be used to
prove the execution of arbitrary EVM and WASM user
programs).

Trail of Bits 16 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

However, some of the complexity stems from its maturity
and the state of some of the features of the
dependencies that Stylus relies on (e.g., Wasmer and the
Go compiler); the Stylus developers had to create
workarounds for some of the current shortcomings of
these dependencies until they are addressed in future
versions. Currently, the following are the two biggest
sources of complexity:


1. The existence of a third execution mode (JIT),
which uses system threads and synchronous
communication to execute Stylus programs.
While we understand the reasoning behind the
existence of this mode and we do not
recommend removing it immediately, it definitely
adds a lot of complexity to the code, as it is
basically a third execution path with its own
particular nuances. We recommend considering
removing this execution mode over the long term
as the codebase matures.


2. Because the Go compiler does not support
exports for WASM to call back into Go, Stylus
programs cannot perform host I/O operations
directly; instead, they have to rely on co-threads
and requests. This adds another layer of
complexity due to the back-and-forth
communication.


Decentralization The Stylus VM does not alter the decentralization
characteristics of Arbitrum networks that integrate it.


Documentation During the review, the Offchain Labs team consistently
provided us with documentation, in the form of a Notion
file, to help us understand the system and the features
under review. As expected, given the duration of this
review, the system evolved during the engagement; for
example, the JavaScript environment was replaced by
WASI, which made certain details of the documentation
outdated. To facilitate future audits, we recommend that
the Offchain Labs team bring the documentation up to
date with the current state of the codebase and formalize
it in a single source.


Additionally, we were provided with a couple of code

Verification



walkthroughs during the engagement, which we found
extremely useful for understanding the system. We
recommend developing a public-facing (or, at least,
internal) walkthrough for newcomers to understand the
system.


Finally, there are certain nuances, assumptions, and
component properties that need more documentation,
such as the way memory/object ownership between Rust
and Go works and the limitations of the pointers passed
by Stylus programs when executing host I/O operations.
These nuances are well known and understood by the
Stylus team but need to be written down to be
referenced by both reviewers and developers.


The WASM program activation code relies heavily on
inserted snippets of WASM instructions in order to make
untrusted code reliable to run in validators. Each of the
middleware used needs additional documentation to
explain in detail (e.g., line by line) how the assembly is
used and how it is expected to run.


Both Go and Rust are languages that safely manage
memory; however, a lot of the Go and Rust code in the
codebase bypasses memory safeness in order to
perform cross-language calls. This is a potential source of
high-severity issues, which are usually very hard to detect
through manual review. While static analyzers are usually
capable of reasoning about the memory safety of
languages such as Go and Rust, this codebase uses
unsafe features, which renders the reasoning ineffective.


Finally, the use of random testing is limited; it should be
expanded, as it seems to be the best tool available to find
this kind of issue.


There are extensive unit tests, such as the ones found in
the `system_tests` folder, for most parts of the system;
however, the system needs extensive unit tests for
scenarios such as corner cases. Additionally, random
testing (a.k.a. fuzzing) is sporadically used; we
recommend expanding the use of random testing for a
more end-to-end approach. More extensive testing
recommendations are provided in appendix F and
appendix G.

There are certain instances in which transaction ordering
could lead to unintended behavior, such as when placing
bids or making space in the long-term cache contract
(TOB-STYLUS-38); however, these are expected in this

## Detailed Findings



Data Validation **Medium**



1. Gas for WASM program activation not charged early enough


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-1


Target: `arbos/programs/programs.go`


Description
The gas for activating WASM programs is not charged early enough in the activation code to
prevent denial-of-service attacks.


WASM activation is a computationally expensive operation that involves decompressing
bytecode (figure 1.1).

```
 func (p Programs) ActivateProgram(evm *vm.EVM, program common.Address, debugMode
 bool) (uint16, bool, error) {
     statedb := evm.StateDB
     codeHash := statedb.GetCodeHash(program)

     version, err := p.StylusVersion()
     if err != nil {
         return 0, false, err
     }
     latest, err := p.CodehashVersion(codeHash)
     if err != nil {
         return 0, false, err
     }
     // Already compiled and found in the machine versions mapping.
     if latest >= version {
         return 0, false, ProgramUpToDateError()
     }
     wasm, err := getWasm(statedb, program)
     if err != nil {
         return 0, false, err
     }
   {...omitted for brevity...}

```

Trail of Bits 23 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

```
 }

 func getWasm(statedb vm.StateDB, program common.Address) ([]byte, error) {
     {...omitted for brevity...}
     return arbcompress.Decompress(wasm, MaxWasmSize)
 }
```

_Figure 1.1: WASM program activation–related code in_ _`[arbos/programs/programs.go#L84](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/blob/3b3a1a422e5093791087a5a65a9c36123d399b22/arbos/programs/programs.go#L84)`_

_and_ _`[#L233](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/blob/3b3a1a422e5093791087a5a65a9c36123d399b22/arbos/programs/programs.go#L233)`_


However, if Brotli’s decompression fails, the user will not be charged for activating the
program, which can be expensive.


Exploit Scenario
Eve creates a specially crafted compressed WASM bytecode with a corrupted bit at the end,
with the purpose of slowing down the Arbitrum chain. The corrupted bit causes a failure
during decompression, allowing her to avoid paying full price for her program, making her
attack cheaper than expected.


Recommendations
Short term, charge gas as early as possible during WASM program activation; gas should be
charged even if activation fails for any reason.


Long term, review each computationally expensive operation that can be arbitrarily
triggered by users to ensure it is properly priced.

2. Project contains no build instructions


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Testing Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-2


Target: `README.md`


Description
The Stylus repository contains information regarding the project, a roadmap, and
information regarding gas pricing, but it lacks other essential information. The repository’s
README should include at least the following:


  - Instructions for building the project


  - Instructions for running the built artifacts


  - Instructions for running the project’s tests


Note that the repository contains a makefile with convenient scripts; however, repositories
of this size (e.g., involving a lot of dependencies and Git submodules) are often difficult to
build even for experienced developers. Therefore, having building instructions and
solutions to common build problems would greatly speed up developer onboarding.


Exploit Scenario
Alice, a developer, tries to build the Stylus repository; however, she faces problems building
it due to the missing documentation in the README, and she makes a mistake in the
procedure that causes the build to fail.


Recommendations
Short term, add the minimum information listed above to the repository’s README. This
will help developers to build, run, and test the project.


Long term, as the project evolves, ensure that the README is updated. This will help ensure
that it does not communicate incorrect information to users.

3. WASM Merkleization is computationally expensive


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-3


Target: `arbitrator/prover/src/machine.rs`


Description
A WASM binary with a large global table (e.g., `(table (;0;) 1000000 1000000`
`externref)` ) will require a few seconds of computation to iterate over and hash all table
elements (figure 3.1).


```
// Merkleize things if requested
for module in &mut modules {

```

```
for table in module.tables.iter_mut() {

```

```
table.elems_merkle = Merkle::new(

```

```
        MerkleType::TableElement,
        table.elems.iter().map(TableElement::hash).collect(),
     );
   }

   let tables_hashes: Result<_, _> =
 module.tables.iter().map(Table::hash).collect();
   module.tables_merkle = Merkle::new(MerkleType::Table, tables_hashes?);

   if always_merkleize {
     module.memory.cache_merkle_tree();
   }
 }

```

Exploit Scenario
Eve creates a specially crafted WASM binary containing huge global tables, slowing down
the chain.


Recommendations
Short term, reduce the number of table elements that a global table can have to speed up
the module parsing process. Consider charging ink for this computation based on the
number of elements hashed.


Long term, review each computationally expensive operation that can be arbitrarily
<u>triggered by users to ensure it is properly priced.</u>

4. WASM binaries lack memory protections against corruption


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-4


Target: `arbitrator`


Description
Arbitrum compiles user program components to WASM to be run on the network. WASM
binaries do not feature modern binary protections that are available by default in native
binaries; they are missing most of the common memory safety checks and are vulnerable
to related attack primitives (figure 4.1). Arbitrum’s compilation to WASM could introduce
deviations between native and on-chain execution of a user program.


_Figure 4.1: An overview of the attack primitives and the missing defenses in the binaries_


[The USENIX 2020 paper “Everything Old Is New Again: Binary Security of WebAssembly”](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/lehmann)
describes in depth the binary defenses that are missing and new attacks that can be
exploited in WASM binaries if memory-unsafe operations are performed.


Trail of Bits 27 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


Other languages provide memory safety in the compiler. Therefore, code that executes
safely natively with such checks may not execute the same on-chain.


Exploit Scenario

A user creates a Stylus contract using C/C++ that contains an unsafe memory operation.
The user tests the code natively, running it with all the compiler protections enabled, which
prevent that operation from being an issue. However, once the user deploys the contract
on-chain, an attacker exploits the unsafe memory operation with a shellcode.


Recommendations
Short term, provide documentation advising users to use memory-safe languages.
Additionally, advise users to perform extensive testing of any memory-unsafe code that is
compiled to WASM to prevent exploitable memory issues.


Long term, review the state of the WASM compiler to evaluate the maturity of its binary
protections.

5. Ink is charged preemptively for reading and writing to memory


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-5


Target: `arbitrator/stylus/src/host.rs`


Description
Some host operations for reading and writing to a WASM program’s memory charge ink
before it is clear whether the operations will be successful or how much ink should really
be charged.


For example, in the `read_return_data` function, the user is charged for the operation to
write `size` bytes at the start of the host operation. However, the data to be written is the
returned data of size `data.len()`, which could actually be smaller than the originally
provided `size` . If `data.len()` is smaller than `size`, the user will be charged more ink than
they should be.


```
pub(crate) fn read_return_data<E: EvmApi>(

```

```
  mut env: WasmEnvMut<E>,
  dest: u32,
  offset: u32,
  size: u32,
) -> Result<u32, Escape> {

```

```
let mut env = WasmEnv::start(&mut env, EVM_API_INK)?;
env.pay_for_write(size.into())?;

```

```
   let data = env.evm_api.get_return_data(offset, size);
   assert!(data.len() <= size as usize);
   env.write_slice(dest, &data)?;

   let len = data.len() as u32;
   trace!("read_return_data", env, [be!(dest), be!(offset)], data, len)
 }

```

_Figure 5.1: Ink is charged for writing_ _`size`_ _bytes, even though the data to be written could be_

_smaller than_ _`size`_ _. (_ _`[arbitrator/stylus/src/host.rs#L273-L289](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/blob/fc0a69d9a9e9fecfa7ae7ed028d16fc84b4ee62a/arbitrator/stylus/src/host.rs#L273-L289)`_ _)_


Exploit Scenario
A WASM contract calls `read_return_data`, passing in a very large `size` parameter (100
MB). The EVM API, however, returns only 32 bytes, and the user is overcharged.


Trail of Bits 29 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


Recommendations
Short term, modify the `read_return_data` function to require the user to have enough
ink available for writing `size` bytes but to charge ink for writing only `data.len()` bytes.
Make similar changes in all host operations that charge ink preemptively.


Long term, review the way ink is charged across different components and levels of
abstraction. Make sure it is consistent and follows how the EVM works. Document any
discrepancies in the charging of ink.

6. Integer overflow vulnerability in brotli-sys


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Patching Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-6


Target: `arbitrator`


Description
Running `cargo audit` on the codebase reveals an integer overflow vulnerability in
`brotli-sys`, a dependency inherited in the Stylus repository. The dependency does not
currently have an update available to fix the vulnerability. Note, however, that the affected
functions are not used.


Dependencies should be kept up to date with any fixes to reduce the surface of potentially
exploitable code. If no fixes exist for vulnerabilities in dependencies, the relevant area of
the code should be clearly documented for developers, including explicit warnings about
the vulnerabilities, to ensure that new code does not use vulnerable dependency code.


Exploit Scenario
Alice, an Offchain Labs developer, adds new functionality to the system that uses the
`brotli-sys` streaming functions that are affected by the reported vulnerability,
introducing an exploitable integer overflow vulnerability into the codebase.


Recommendations
Short term, document the `brotli-sys` streaming functions that are affected by the
integer overflow vulnerability with clear warnings for future developers making changes in
the system.


Long term, add `cargo audit` to the continuous integration pipeline to ensure that new
vulnerabilities are caught quickly. Moreover, continue to monitor dependencies and update
them when new versions are available.

7. Reliance on outdated dependencies


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Undetermined**


Type: Patching Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-7


Target: `arbitrator`


Description
Updated versions of many dependencies of Arbitrum Stylus (and its submodules) are
available. Dependency maintainers commonly release updates that contain silent bug fixes,
so all dependencies should be periodically reviewed and updated wherever possible.


Dependencies that can be updated are listed in table 7.1, as reported by `cargo upgrade`
through the `cargo upgrade --incompatible --dry-run` command.


**Dependency** **Version Used** **Latest Available Version**

```
 thiserror 1.0.33 1.0.49

 libc 0.2.108 0.2.149

 eyre 0.6.5 0.6.8

 sha3 0.10.5 0.10.18

```

_Table 7.1: Dependencies in the Stylus repository for which updates are available_


Exploit Scenario
Eve learns of a vulnerability in an outdated version of a `sha3` dependency. Knowing that
Stylus relies on the outdated version, she exploits the vulnerability.


Recommendations
Short term, update the dependencies to their latest versions wherever possible. Verify that
all unit tests pass following such updates. Document any reasons for not updating a
dependency.


Long term, add `cargo upgrade --incompatible --dry-run` into the continuous
integration pipeline to ensure that new vulnerabilities are caught quickly. Moreover,
continue to monitor dependencies and update them when new versions are available.

8. WASM validation relies on Wasmer code that could result in undefined
behavior


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-8


Target: `arbitrator/stylus/tools/wasmer/lib/types/src/vmoffsets.rs`


Description
The use of Wasmer code for validating WASM binaries could result in undefined behavior.


Stylus uses Wasmer to perform a strict validation of WASM binaries before activating them.
For instance, the following function computes the memory offset for each WASM binary
component:

```
   fn precompute(&mut self) {
     /// Offset base by num_items items of size item_size, panicking on overflow
     fn offset_by(base: u32, num_items: u32, item_size: u32) -> u32 {
        base.checked_add(num_items.checked_mul(item_size).unwrap())
          .unwrap()
     }

     self.vmctx_signature_ids_begin = 0;
     self.vmctx_imported_functions_begin = offset_by(
        self.vmctx_signature_ids_begin,
        self.num_signature_ids,
        u32::from(self.size_of_vmshared_signature_index()),
     );
     self.vmctx_imported_tables_begin = offset_by(
        self.vmctx_imported_functions_begin,
        self.num_imported_functions,
        u32::from(self.size_of_vmfunction_import()),
     );
```

_Figure 8.1: The header of the_ _`precompute`_ _function in_
```
           lib/types/src/vmoffsets.rs#L282–309

```

However, this code relies on unsafe memory operations: it is not guaranteed that the
memory pointers are properly aligned, and these pointers can be dereferenced later.
Dereferencing of a misaligned memory pointer is undefined behavior (figure 8.2).

Description
During the execution of natively compiled WASM code, certain code that handles
exceptions could produce false positives in the AddressSanitizer (ASan) checks.


Stylus allows users to compile WASM programs into native code and execute it, using
Wasmer. While the produced native code looks correct, it seems to be incompatible with

However, the check in figure 10.2 ( `if latest >= version` ) implies that a program could
have been activated using a Stylus version higher than the current one, which could be the
case if the chain’s Stylus version is reverted to a previous one after a program is activated;
in that case, this check would prevent that program from being reactivated and updated
with the current Stylus version.


This behavior in of itself does not necessarily have to be a problem; however, as shown in
figure 10.3, a program can be called through the `callProgram` function only when the
program’s activation version matches the current Stylus version of the chain, which further
contradicts the check performed by the activation function.

```
 if program.version != stylusVersion {
     return nil, ProgramOutOfDateError(program.version)
 }

Recommendations
Short term, consider whether reactivation of a program should be allowed only when the
program’s activation version is different from the current Stylus version. This would allow
reactivation exclusively when there is a version change; however, note that this might be
undesired behavior and should therefore be thoroughly studied.


Long term, document the intended flow for program reactivation under a Stylus version
change and consider issues and edge cases that could arise when old programs are
reactivated with a different set of instrumentations.

11. Memory leak in capture_hostio


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-11


Target: `stylus/arbitrator/stylus/src/evm_api.rs`


Description
In the `capture_hostio` function, the `RustBytes` function `new` calls `mem::forget`, but the
allocation is never freed, leaking memory. This may cause excess resource consumption;
however, this code appears to be used only when tracing is enabled (presumably in debug
mode).

```
 fn capture_hostio(&self, name: &str, args: &[u8], outs: &[u8], start_ink: u64,
 end_ink: u64) {

Recommendations
Short term, have the code explicitly drop `RustBytes` . Alternatively, use `RustSlice`, which
`rustc` will automatically free.

Rust, run the tests with `[cargo miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri)` .

Description
[The documentation for](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.forget.html#relationship-with-manuallydrop) `std::mem::forget` states that using it to transfer memory
ownership across FFI boundaries is error-prone. Specifically, modifications that introduce
panics into code that uses `std::mem::forget`, such as the code shown in figures 12.1 and
12.2, may cause double frees, and using a value after calling `as_mut_ptr` and transferring
ownership of the memory is invalid. The documentation advises developers to use
`[ManuallyDrop](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.forget.html#relationship-with-manuallydrop)` instead.

13. Lack of safety documentation for unsafe Rust


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-13


Target: `arbos/programs/programs.go`


Description
The Rust codebase’s unsafe blocks lack safety comments explaining their invariants and
sound usage. Furthermore, safe code and unsafe code are mixed in functions declared
unsafe without distinguishing which blocks of code are unsafe. In future versions of Rust,
[this pattern may be flagged as a warning or even a hard error. Generally, the code would](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2585-unsafe-block-in-unsafe-fn.html)
be less ambiguous if unsafe code were explicitly separated into dedicated blocks even if the
overall function scope is unsafe.


The following output of running `clippy -- -D clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks`
shows the unsafe Rust blocks in Stylus that lack documentation on their safety
assumptions.

```

```

_Figure 13.1: Output of the Clippy linter_


Unsafe Rust blocks should always contain safety comments explaining why the unsafe Rust
is sound and does not exhibit undefined behavior.


Even if the code is not currently being used in a way that creates undefined behavior, the
current Stylus APIs can be used in an unsound manner. Consider the following example:

**PUBLIC**


```
let x = vec![1u8; 1000];
let y = GoSliceData{

```

```
  ptr: x.as_ptr(),

};
let mut a = RustBytes::new(x);
unsafe {

```

```
  stylus_vec_set_bytes(&mut a as *mut RustBytes, y);
}

```

[Miri (a tool for detecting undefined behavior) issues a warning on the code in figure 13.2:](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri)

```
 Undefined Behavior: deallocating while item [SharedReadOnly for <1851>] is strongly
 protected by call 812
```

_Figure 13.3: Miri’s output when run on the code in figure 13.2_


The `stylus_vec_set_bytes` function does not contain sufficient documentation that
covers this possible unsafe use.

```
 ///

 #[no_mangle]
 pub unsafe extern "C" fn stylus_vec_set_bytes(rust: *mut RustBytes, data:
 GoSliceData) {
   let rust = &mut *rust;
   let mut vec = Vec::from_raw_parts(rust.ptr, rust.len, rust.cap);
   vec.clear();
   vec.extend(data.slice());

 }
```

The unsafe `write` function also lacks documentation highlighting its possible misuse:

```
 unsafe fn write(&mut self, mut vec: Vec<u8>) {
   self.ptr = vec.as_mut_ptr();
   self.len = vec.len();
   self.cap = vec.capacity();
   mem::forget(vec);
 }

The `write` function will leak memory if called consecutively without explicitly freeing `vec`,
<u>such as by using</u> <u>`stylus_vec_set_bytes`</u> <u>(fgure 13.6), but this is undocumented.i</u>


Trail of Bits 43 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

 let mut two = RustBytes::new(one);
 unsafe {
   two.write(vec![1u8; 1000]);
   two.write(vec![1u8; 1000]);
 }
```

_Figure 13.6: An example of how_ _`write`_ _could be misused_


For functions that are called via Cgo, we recommend documenting where memory is
allocated and whether the caller is responsible for manually freeing the memory or, in the
case of Go, whether it will be garbage collected.


Recommendations
Short term, set the `undocumented_unsafe_blocks`, `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn`, and
`missing_safety_doc` lints to `deny` .


Long term, ensure that any implicit assumptions are documented in the code so that they
are not forgotten.

Union types used in Wasmer that cross FFI boundaries and unconditionally transmute

15. Stylus’s 63/64th gas forwarding differs from go-ethereum

Target: `audit-stylus/arbos/programs/api.go`,
```
 audit-stylus/arbitrator/stylus/src/host.rs

```

Description
The Stylus VM deviates from the Ethereum specification and the behavior of the reference
implementation in its application of the 63/64th gas forwarding rule, defined in EIP-150.


[EIP-150 states that “if a call asks for more gas than all but one 64th of the maximum](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-150.md)
allowed amount, call with all but one 64th of the maximum allowed amount of gas.”


The Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol calculates the “all but one 64th” amount
in the `callGas` function. The new rule is applied only when the requested amount of gas
exceeds the allowed gas computed using the rule.

```
 evm.callGasTemp, err = callGas(evm.chainRules.IsEIP150, contract.Gas, gas,
 stack.Back(0))

        availableGas = availableGas - base
        gas := availableGas - availableGas/64
        // If the bit length exceeds 64 bit we know that the newly calculated
"gas" for EIP150

```

```
        // is smaller than the requested amount. Therefore we return the new
gas instead

        return gas, nil
    }

On the other hand, Stylus applies the 63/64th rule indiscriminately using the minimum
value of the requested gas amount and the gas available to the parent call. The 63/64th
rule should be applied only if the call requests more than “all but one 64th” of the gas.

```
 gas = gas.min(env.gas_left()?); // provide no more than what the user has

 let contract = env.read_bytes20(contract)?;
 let input = env.read_slice(calldata, calldata_len)?;
 let value = value.map(|x| env.read_bytes32(x)).transpose()?;

Target: `arbitrator/prover/src/programs/mod.rs`


Description
When a user WASM program is parsed, certain limits are enforced in the program (figure
19.1). These limits are undocumented, so they might be unexpected for users.


Additionally, while those limits serve as protection against denial of service and extra
checks for bugs, not all of the WASM binary fields are explicitly limited. For example, the
number of imports (the `imports` field) is not checked, yet this number is constrained by
the imports available to the implementation (VM, host modules, etc.).

The `argumentData` instruction is missing sanity checks in certain cases.


In most cases, `argumentData` is checked to ensure it does not contain any unexpected and

```
 // Jump to the target

However, in some cases, such as in the `executeCrossModuleInternalCall` function
(figure 17.2), `argumentData` is simply truncated or unchecked.

However, this case would mean that incorrectly parsed WASM code is being executed,
which is unlikely.


Recommendation
Short term, include the missing sanity checks for `argumentData` to ensure the upper bits
are not set for small value types. Add these checks in all instances mentioned in the finding
as well as any others that are identified.


Long term, consider adding more sanity checks in areas of the code where the security of
many parts relies on one assumption.

18. Discrepancy in EIP-2200 implementation


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-18


Target: `stylus/go-ethereum/core/vm/operations_acl_arbitrum.go`


Description
The `WasmStateStoreCost` function, which is an adaptation of `go-ethereum` ’s
`makeGasSStoreFunc` function, introduces a discrepancy from the original code (and a
deviation from the EIP-2200 specification) when performing EIP-2200’s “stipend check.”


In particular, as shown in figure 18.2, the “stipend check” is performed in the original code
as a “less than or equal to” comparison.


```
func makeGasSStoreFunc(clearingRefund uint64) gasFunc {

```

```
    return func(evm *EVM, contract *Contract, stack *Stack, mem *Memory,
memorySize uint64) (uint64, error) {

```

```
// If we fail the minimum gas availability invariant, fail (0)
if contract.Gas <= params.SstoreSentryGasEIP2200 {

```

```
    return 0, errors.New("not enough gas for reentrancy sentry")
}

```

In Stylus’s version of the code, the stipend check is meant to be performed by the caller of
the function.

```
 // Computes the cost of doing a state store in wasm
 // Note: the code here is adapted from makeGasSStoreFunc with the most recent
 parameters as of The Merge
 // Note: the sentry check must be done by the caller
 func WasmStateStoreCost(db StateDB, program common.Address, key, value common.Hash)
 uint64 {
```

For example, the check is handled in the `user_host__storage_store_bytes32` function
as part of the host operations (figure 18.3).

```
 pub unsafe extern "C" fn user_host__storage_store_bytes32(key: usize, value: usize)
 {

However, the check is performed as a strictly “less than” comparison, thereby introducing a
discrepancy from EIP-2200 and from the code being adapted (note that `require_gas` calls
`require_ink` ).

```
 fn require_ink(&mut self, ink: u64) -> Result<(), OutOfInkError> {
   let ink_left = self.ink_ready()?;
   if ink_left < ink {
     return self.out_of_ink();
   }
   Ok(())
 }
```

Note that in this particular case, the deviation does not lead to any security issues.


This discrepancy also appears in the `storage_store_bytes32` function.


Recommendation
Short term, modify the two affected functions so that they perform the stipend check using
a “less than or equal to” comparison, per the EIP-2200 specification.


Long term, whenever code is being adapted from a different source, thoroughly document
any expected deviations; additionally, adapt the original tests, which can help identify any
expected deviations.

19. Tests missing assertions for some errors and values


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Error Reporting Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-19


Target: `stylus/arbitrator/prover/src/binary.rs`


Description
Many of the tests in the codebase perform incomplete assertions, which may prevent the
tests from detecting bugs in the event of future code changes. In particular, some tests
check only the following:


  - Whether an error was returned, but not the type or the message of the error


  - Whether the resulting structure’s field values are as expected


Additionally, the tests do not test all edge cases. For example, there are no unit tests that
ensure that the enforced WASM limits (mentioned in TOB-STYLUS-16) actually work.


Those issues can be seen, for example, in the prover’s tests, as shown in figure 19.1.

```
 #[test]
 pub fn reject_reexports() {
   let wasm = as_wasm(...);
   let _ = binary::parse(&wasm, Path::new("")).unwrap_err();

   let wasm = as_wasm(...);
   let _ = binary::parse(&wasm, Path::new("")).unwrap_err();
 }

Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Medium**

Target: `stylus/arbitrator/prover/src/machine.rs`


Description
The code for serialization and deserialization of the machine state does not account for any
error guards (figure 20.1). If any error guards are present, they could produce an invalid
machine state when the prover is run from a deserialized state.

```
 pub fn serialize_state<P: AsRef<Path>>(&self, path: P) -> Result<()> {
   let mut f = File::create(path)?;
   let mut writer = BufWriter::new(&mut f);

When a machine state is serialized and later deserialized—as is the case when
`CreateValidationNode` is run (figure 20.2)—the information about any error guards is
lost.

```
 func CreateValidationNode(configFetcher ValidationConfigFetcher, stack *node.Node,
 fatalErrChan chan error) (*ValidationNode, error) {
```

This would result in a mismatch between the actual machine state and that which starts
from a serialized state.


Exploit Scenario
Alice creates a validation node from a serialized machine state. Because the error guards
were not included during serialization, the correct execution of the machine is now
undetermined.

21. Lack of minimum-value check for program activation


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-21


Target: `stylus/precompiles/ArbWasm.go`


Description
The cost for activating WASM programs is paid in native currency instead of gas. However,
there is no check of the supplied native currency at the start of the program activation
code. This is presumably because the cost is not known up front; nonetheless, a simple
zero-value or minimum-value check could prevent the need to perform unnecessary
computation if the user supplies insufficient value.

```
 // Compile a wasm program with the latest instrumentation
 func (con ArbWasm) ActivateProgram(c ctx, evm mech, value huge, program addr)
 (uint16, error) {
     debug := evm.ChainConfig().DebugMode()

     // charge a fixed cost up front to begin activation
     if err := c.Burn(1659168); err != nil {
         return 0, err
     }
     version, codeHash, moduleHash, dataFee, takeAllGas, err :=

Description
The `SetWasmKeepaliveDays` function sets the `ExpiryDays` value instead of the

Exploit Scenario
An admin makes a call to `SetWasmKeepaliveDays` with the intention of extending the life
of some programs; however, they inadvertently expire all programs, as the function

23. Potential nil dereference error in Node.Start


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Undetermined**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-23


Target: `stylus/arbnode/node.go`


Description
The `Node.Start` function may crash the node due to a `nil` dereference error.


A nil dereference error can happen when `Node.Start` calls `n.configFetcher.Get`
(figure 23.1). We assume that `n.configFetcher` can be `nil`, as suggested by the `nil`
check at the end of the `Node.Start` function. If `n.configFetcher` is `nil`, a `nil`
dereference error will occur when `Node.Start` calls the `LiveConfig` type’s `Get` method
on it (figure 23.2).


We have not determined whether `n.configFetcher` can actually be `nil` .

```
 func (n *Node) Start(ctx context.Context) error {
     // config is the static config at start, not a dynamic config
     config := n.configFetcher.Get()

     (...)

     if n.configFetcher != nil {
         n.configFetcher.Start(ctx)
     }
     return nil
 }
```

Recommendation
Short term, verify whether `n.configFetcher` can be `nil` in the `Node.Start` function; if it
cannot be `nil`, remove the `nil` check from the function, but if it can, refactor the code to
handle that case.

Description
When the `ProgramKeepalive` function calls the `dataPricer.UpdateModel` function, it

Note that when a program is activated, the `DataPricer.UpdateModel` is called correctly
with the number of program bytes instead of kilobytes
( `[stylus/arbos/programs/programs.go#L246–L263](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/blob/cb3c6dd85c7952f86b857f25733a74ae2ed264de/arbos/programs/programs.go#L246-L263)` ). This is because it is called with
the `info.asmEstimate` variable (from the `[activationInfo.asmEstimate](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/blob/cb3c6dd85c7952f86b857f25733a74ae2ed264de/arbos/programs/programs.go#L532)` field), which
is in bytes, instead of the `estimateKb` [variable, which is in kilobytes and which is saved](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/blob/cb3c6dd85c7952f86b857f25733a74ae2ed264de/arbos/programs/programs.go#L254-L271)

Exploit Scenario
A chain owner sets a keepalive for a program, resulting in an incorrect data price model
update and a cheaper execution of the keepalive function.


Recommendations
Short term, take the following actions:


  - Fix the `ProgramKeepalive` function so that it passes in the number of program
bytes in bytes instead of kilobytes to the `dataPrice.UpdateModel` function. Note
that this may require code changes in the `ActivateProgram` function as well so
that both price model update calls receive the same value for the program bytes
amount.


  - Change the name of the `asmEstimate` field in the `Program` type to `asmEstimateKb`
to prevent similar issues in the future (unless the field is refactored to hold the
number of bytes).


Long term, add tests for this functionality.

Target: `stylus/arbitrator/prover/src/machine.rs`


Description
The `from_binaries` function parses WASM modules from binaries that have either Rust

Exploit Scenario
A user creates a Rust program that includes a `run` function marked with the `no_mangle`
attribute and compiles it to a WASM module to deploy it to the network. The user wastes
funds deploying and activating the module, as it ends up being unusable due to the
creation of incorrect entrypoint code during the WASM module parsing process.


Recommendations
Short term, have the `from_binaries` function check whether both Rust and Go support is
included and, if so, error out the processing and inform the user that they cannot have
both function names. Additionally, have the function log a message to inform the user
whenever Rust or Go support is detected and that the entrypoint code has been
instrumented as such. This will help users to understand how their code has been
instrumented.

26. Computation of internal stack hash uses wrong prefix string


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Undetermined**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-26


Target: `stylus/arbitrator/prover/src/machine.rs`


Description
The `prover::machine::Machine::stack_hashes` function computes hashes of the
co-thread frame stacks, value stacks, and internal stack using a prefix string (figure 26.1).
The value stack and the internal stack pass in the same prefix ( `“Value”` ) to the hash
computation macros, so certain sub-hashes of the value stack ( `first_hash`, shown in the
figure, and `last_hash`, omitted from the figure) may have the same value as the internal
stack hash.


This does not seem to create any security risk, but it seems that the prefix for the internal
stack was intended to be different from other stack prefixes.

```
 fn stack_hashes(&self) -> (FrameStackHash, ValueStackHash, InterStackHash) {
   macro_rules! compute {
     ($stack:expr, $prefix:expr) => {{
        let frames = $stack.iter().map(|v| v.hash());
        hash_stack(frames, concat!($prefix, " stack:"))
     }};
   }
   macro_rules! compute_multistack {
     ($field:expr, $stacks:expr, $prefix:expr, $hasher: expr) => {{
        let first_elem = *$stacks.first().unwrap();
        let first_hash = hash_stack(
          first_elem.iter().map(|v| v.hash()),
          concat!($prefix, " stack:"),
        );
        // (...) - more code
     }};
   }
   let frame_stacks = compute_multistack!(/* (...) */, "Stack frame",/* (...) */);

Recommendations


Trail of Bits 68 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


Change the prefix used for the internal stack hash computation in the `stack_hashes`
function to `“Internal”` . While this may not change any security property of the system, it
will remove a possibility of a hash collision (between the internal stack hash and a partial
hash from the value stack), which could create confusion if seen.

27. WASI preview 1 may be incompatible with future versions


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Undetermined**


Type: Patching Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-27


Target: Stylus interop layer, WASI


Description
[Stylus was recently updated to use Go 1.21’s WASI preview 1 for its WASM execution.](https://go.dev/blog/wasi)
(Previously, WASM was run through a JavaScript engine embedded in the Rust code.)
[However, since this iteration of WASI is only a preview and, according to a related issue on](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/58141)
[Go’s GitHub repository, “this interface is evolving without the insurance of backward](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/58141)
compatibility,” it may require additional effort to add support for WASI preview 2 and
future WASI versions.


Recommendations
Long term, track the developments of support for WASI preview 2 in Go. Make sure to work
around any version incompatibilities when updating the Stylus codebase to future WASI
versions.

28. Possible out-of-bounds write in strncpy function in Stylus C SDK


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-28


Target: `stylus/arbitrator/langs/c/src/simplelib.c`


Description
The `strncpy` function defined in the Stylus C SDK writes past the destination string when
the source string ( `src` ) is shorter than the number of bytes ( `num` ) to write to the destination
string (figure 28.1).


This causes another area of the memory of the program to be overwritten, which may have
various consequences depending on the program code and its memory layout.

```
 char *strncpy(char *dst, const char *src, size_t num) {
   size_t idx=0;
   while (idx<num && src[idx]!=0) {
     idx++;
   }
   memcpy(dst, src, idx);
   if (idx < num) {
     memset(dst+num, 0, num-idx);
   }
   return dst;
 }
```

This bug can be detected by compiling an example program using this function (figure 28.2)

Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-29


Target:
```

Description
The `memcpy` utility function, used to implement `ConstString` functions in the Stylus Rust
SDK, contains an insufficient check against out-of-bounds conditions: it misses the
following conditions that would cause a program to write past the destination buffer:


  - The offset is equal to the destination length.


  - The source length is larger than the destination length.


```
/// Copies data from `source` to `dest` in a `const` context.
/// This function is very inefficient for other purposes.

30. Unused and unset timeouts in Arbitrator's JIT code


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Configuration Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-30

Description
There are potential issues with timeouts in the Arbitrator’s JIT code:


1. Read and write operations for sockets created in the `ready_hostio` function (figure

data, the lack of timeout could result in a denial of service.


2. The `ProcessEnv::child_timeout` field, which is set to 15 seconds (figure 30.2), is
unused across the codebase.

```

The discrepancy means that the Stylus VM upgrade will cause an inconsistent state
between the hash of the Stylus VM and the previous Nitro VM hash, which is important to
take into account when fraud proving is activated.


Exploit Scenario
Alice and Bob enter a challenge before the upgrade of the Stylus VM and OSP contracts.
The upgrade occurs and causes a mismatch between the current and previous machine
states, so the OSP cannot be run and Alice and Bob are both blocked from proving their
state. Bob loses the challenge due to a timeout.

Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-32


Target: `stylus/contracts/src/state/Machine.sol`


Description
The OSP `Machine` contract does not handle unexpected state transitions when executing a
single opcode in a consistent manner.


In some cases (such as when `setPc` is called), the machine enters an errored state when an
unexpected value type is found or when the program counter content contains unexpected
data.

   }
   if (!setPcFromData(mach, pc.contents)) {

In other cases (such as when the machine is recovering from an errored state and
`setPcFromRecovery` fails), this unexpected case is simply ignored.

sound and safe strategy to handle them.

33. Potential footguns and attack vectors due to new memory model


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-33


Target: `arbos/programs/programs.go`


Description
The Stylus memory model introduces new concepts that might be surprising to developers
who are familiar with the EVM model; these new concepts could also introduce potential
attack vectors.


The Stylus memory model uses a global memory model, in which each new memory page
allocation is priced exponentially given the number of pages shared across all user
programs. This is in contrast to the EVM, which prices memory quadratically and
independently of other programs’/contracts’ use of memory.


With certain patterns (e.g., ERC-4337 `UserOperation` forwarding/relaying), it may be
essential to have predictable costs for memory expansion in the current context in order to
ensure that relayed calls are executed with the conditions the original signer intended.
Because a relayed call typically involves handling memory, these costs must be taken into
account for the outer call that wraps the inner call. If these costs can be influenced by
previous user programs allocating a large number of memory pages, it might open up new
attack vectors.


Exploit Scenario
A relaying contract wraps an inner call with a fixed amount of gas. The inner call requires
memory allocation. Because the outer call can open an arbitrary number of memory pages,
the inner call fails unexpectedly due to the increased gas cost of global memory allocation.


Recommendations
Long term, make developers aware of any deviation from the EVM model and its potential
security considerations.

When there is no need to share storage state between two calls, storage caches can
operate independently of each other without any issues. However, in the EVM contract,
storage state is shared for delegated and reentrant calls.


A call that would share storage state would also create a new storage cache struct, which
can cause the first storage cache to become out of sync when the second cache modifies
some of the first cache’s “known” values. Known values are those that the storage cache
thinks are located in the state trie.


Such situations could cause storage reads to be incorrect or outdated and write operations
to be omitted.


Exploit Scenario
A multisignature Stylus program `SmartWallet` allows arbitrary program execution with
one important invariant: the ownership of the program is not allowed to change after the
execution of the inner call (figure 34.3). Because the inner call is a reentrant call, the
storage cache becomes out of sync; this causes the ownership invariant check to be faulty,
allowing it to be bypassed (figures 34.4–34.5).

Short term, modify the associated code so that the storage cache’s values are committed
beforehand whenever delegated or reentrant calls are possible. Alternatively, consider
sharing storage caches between call frames. However, the second option will likely come
with significant code inefficiencies and overhead.


Long term, thoroughly document the intended behavior of the cache, including whether it
should persist across calls and any potentially unsafe uses for Stylus developers.

35. Storage cache can be written to in a static call context


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-35


Target: `stylus/arbitrator/arbutil/src/evm/req.rs`


Description
The storage cache can be written to inside of a static call context, which can lead to
confusing and unexpected behavior.


The storage cache is intended to minimize storage read and write operations. When the
storage cache is flushed, only the values that have changed from the known values (i.e.,
values that are “dirty”) are committed to the persistent storage state, via the
`EvmApiMethod::SetTrieSlots` method.

```
 fn flush_storage_cache(&mut self, clear: bool, gas_left: u64) -> Result<u64> {
   let mut data = Vec::with_capacity(64 * self.storage_cache.len() + 8);
   data.extend(gas_left.to_be_bytes());

   for (key, value) in &mut self.storage_cache.slots {
     if value.dirty() {
        data.extend(*key);
        data.extend(*value.value);
        value.known = Some(value.value);
     }
   }
   if clear {
     self.storage_cache.clear();
   }
   if data.len() == 8 {
     return Ok(0); // no need to make request
   }

   let (res, _, cost) = self.request(EvmApiMethod::SetTrieSlots, data);
   if res[0] != EvmApiStatus::Success.into() {
     bail!("{}", String::from_utf8_or_hex(res));
   }
   Ok(cost)
 }

```

Values that are not dirty do not result in `EvmApiMethod::SetTrieSlots` requests.


Trail of Bits 89 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


In order for a value to be known, it must be either retrieved from Geth via the `GetBytes32`
EVM API method or committed by the storage cache itself via the `SetTrieSlots` EVM API
method.


This means that a get request can change the behavior of a subsequent storage cache flush
host I/O operation, leading to strange and unexpected behavior inside a static call context
where persistent state changes are not permitted.


Exploit Scenario
Inside of a static call context, storage writes are not allowed. However, writing multiple
values to the storage cache is allowed if they end up equaling the known values.

```

     unsafe { StorageCache::set_word(slot, value) };
   };
   let flush = || {
     console!("StorageCache::flush()");
     StorageCache::flush();
   };
   if msg::reentrant() {
     get(slot); // If this line is removed, the staticcall fails.

     // Inside staticcall context.
     set(slot, B256::new([0xaa; 32]));
     set(slot, B256::new([0xbb; 32]));

   }

   Ok(vec![])
 }
```

_Figure 35.2: The static call fails if a previous_ _`GetBytes32`_ _EVM API request is removed._


Recommendations
Short term, consider forbidding writes to the storage cache inside of a static call context.
This is especially important if the storage cache is to be shared among reentrant calls, as
explained in the issue TOB-STYLUS-34, as a static call should not be able to influence
another call’s behavior through shared state (aside from gas costs).


Long term, be aware of optimizations that could lead to strange and confusing patterns
when interacting with the system on a higher level.

36. Revert conditions always override user returned status


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-36


Target: `arbitrator/wasm-libraries/user-host/src/link.rs`


Description
Certain corner conditions in Stylus program execution can cause valid executions to be
flagged as reverts.


Once a Stylus program exits early, the `early_exit` flag is used to indicate that `early`
should be set as the exit code in the `program_internal__set_done` function (figure
36.1).

```
 #[no_mangle]
 pub unsafe extern "C" fn program_internal__set_done(mut status: UserOutcomeKind) ->
 u32 {
   use UserOutcomeKind::*;

   let program = Program::current();
   let module = program.module;
   let mut outs = program.outs.as_slice();
   let mut ink_left = program_ink_left(module);

   // apply any early exit codes
   if let Some(early) = program.early_exit {
     status = early;
   }

   // check if instrumentation stopped the program
   if program_ink_status(module) != 0 {
     status = OutOfInk;
     outs = &[];
     ink_left = 0;
   }
   if program_stack_left(module) == 0 {
     status = OutOfStack;
     outs = &[];
     ink_left = 0;
   }

   let gas_left = program.config.pricing.ink_to_gas(ink_left);

   let mut output = Vec::with_capacity(8 + outs.len());
   output.extend(gas_left.to_be_bytes());

```

Trail of Bits 92 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


```
   output.extend(outs);
   program
     .request_handler()
     .set_request(status as u32, &output)
 }
```

_Figure 36.1: The_ _`program_internal__set_done`_ _function in_
```
     arbitrator/wasm-libraries/user-host/src/link.rs#L194–L228

```

However, this function can override the status returned for program executions if either
the ink amount or the stack size is zero, flagging them as reverts. Both of these conditions
can be reached if a program exits early.


Exploit Scenario
Alice optimizes a Stylus program execution to use exactly a certain amount of ink in the
context of a larger DeFi system executing untrusted calls. Her program is called with the
exact amount of ink required to run, so it exits with zero ink left. However, the execution is
flagged as a revert.


Recommendations
Short term, consider changing the `program_internal__set_done` function so that valid
executions resulting in zero gas are not automatically flagged as reverts, making sure the
common out-of-gas and out-of-stack executions are handled correctly.


Long term, review the local and global invariants behind each component to make sure
corner cases are correctly defined and handled.

37. CacheManager bids cannot be increased


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-37


Target: `stylus-contracts/src/chain/CacheManager.sol`


Description
Bids in the cache manager placed on a particular code hash cannot be modified and do not
accumulate.


When a bid is placed, the `CacheManager` Solidity contract checks whether the code hash is
currently cached and reverts the bid if so.


```
/// Places a bid, reverting if payment is insufficient.
function placeBid(bytes32 codehash) external payable {

```

```
if (isPaused) {

```

```
  revert BidsArePaused();
}
if (_isCached(codehash)) {

```

```
  revert AlreadyCached(codehash);
}

```

```
   uint64 asm = _asmSize(codehash);
   (uint256 bid, uint64 index) = _makeSpace(asm);
   return _addBid(bid, codehash, asm, index);
 }
```

_Figure 37.1: This check prevents bids from being placed on already cached programs._

_(_ _`[stylus-contracts/src/chain/CacheManager.sol#104–144](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts/blob/f3445c042a09cbe493aafae3c5136b7f54411298/src/chain/CacheManager.sol#L104-L144)`_ _)_


This makes it impossible to increase a bid before the program is evicted either due to other
bids being placed or through sufficient calls to `makeSpace` .


This limitation creates a bad user experience. A user who wants to increase a bid would
have to create a new bid, but would first have to pay to evict the program. It might also
make it difficult for a popular dapp with many low-capital users to coordinate and combine
their funds for a shared bid.


Exploit Scenario
Bob wants to increase a previous bid to his token program. He cannot simply place a new
bid; he is required to make sufficient space. He calls `makeSpace` to evict his own program,
requiring a 1 ETH payment. In order to add his new 2 ETH bid, he must now pay 3 ETH in
<u>total.</u>


Trail of Bits 94 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


Recommendations
Short term, document this limitation of the auction system. Consider adding an alternative
unsafe function that does not check whether the code is already cached (however, this
would allow multiple entries per code hash). Alternatively, consider adjusting the
implementation to allow bids for programs to be increased.


Long term, review the bid mechanisms with user experience in mind; document any
sources of friction and ways in which they could be mitigated.

front-run


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-38


Target: `stylus-contracts/src/chain/CacheManager.sol`


Description
The `makeSpace` function, used to make space for programs in the cache manager, does not
refund funds sent above the minimum bid value, even if no state changes are performed.


The `makeSpace` function accepts ETH and requires a minimum bid to be made until
enough space is available.


```
/// Evicts entries until enough space exists in the cache, reverting if payment is
insufficient.
/// Returns the new amount of space available on success.
/// Note: will only make up to 5Mb of space. Call repeatedly for more.
function makeSpace(uint64 size) external payable returns (uint64 space) {

```

```
if (size > MAX_MAKE_SPACE) {

```

```
     size = MAX_MAKE_SPACE;
  }
  _makeSpace(size);
  return cacheSize - queueSize;
}

```

```
/// Evicts entries until enough space exists in the cache, reverting if payment is
insufficient.
/// Returns the bid and the index to use for insertion.
function _makeSpace(uint64 size) internal returns (uint256 bid, uint64 index) {
  // discount historical bids by the number of seconds
  bid = msg.value + block.timestamp * uint256(decay);
  index = uint64(entries.length);

  uint256 min;
  while (queueSize + size > cacheSize) {
     (min, index) = _getBid(bids.pop());
     _deleteEntry(min, index);
  }

  }
}

The contract keeps any funds sent above the minimum bid value. This includes the case in
which enough space is already available and no funds are required. This can happen, for
example, when two calls to `makeSpace` are initiated by different parties.


There is also the possibility that a user calls `makeSpace` to create space, only for that space
to be occupied by other bids right after it is freed.


Exploit Scenario
Bob calls `makeSpace` in order to free up space in the cache manager. In the meantime,
Alice calls `makeSpace` herself for the same reason. Bob’s transaction ends up doing nothing
and does not return his funds. Alice is able to insert her program, whereas Bob is where he
was at the start.


Recommendations
Short term, have the cache manager refund any excess funds sent above the minimum bid
required for making enough space.


Long term, document this behavior so that users are aware of it.

39. Bids do not account for program size


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-39


Target: `stylus-contracts/src/chain/CacheManager.sol`


Description
It is possible for a single bid to evict many programs, regardless of their cumulative price
per program byte size, resulting in an unfair auction system.


A program that is to be inserted into the cache manager with a slightly higher bid than
many others will be prioritized over those other programs, regardless of the total amount
paid per occupied code size. This is because the code for adding a bid for a program does
not take into account the program size itself.


```
/// Adds a bid
function _addBid(
  uint256 bid,
  bytes32 code,
  uint64 size,
  uint64 index
) internal {
  if (queueSize + size > cacheSize) {

Exploit Scenario
There are 50 programs in the cache manager, each of size 0.1 MB and a 1 ETH bid. Bob
inserts a new program with a 1.01 ETH bid. If Bob’s program size is 0.1 MB, one program

will be evicted (1 ETH worth of bids). If the program size is 5 MB, 50 programs will be
evicted (50 ETH worth of bids).


Bob’s program should not be able to evict any number of programs without paying extra
fees.


Recommendations
Short term, consider dividing the bid in `_addBid` by the program size in order to charge a
price per byte instead of a fixed price per program.

program sizes.

Description
The `_makeSpace` function allows new bids to go through if they are equal to the current bid
(figure 40.1). This is unexpected for an auction system, in which new bids should be
considered only if they are superior to previous ones.

Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-41


Target: `prover/src/programs/meter.rs`, `prover/src/programs/heap.rs`


Description
The ink charged by the `MemoryGrow` opcode is less than expected for programs that have a
fixed memory size.


Stylus defines an ink price for every WASM opcode to be used during program activation.
The costs for certain opcodes, such as `MemoryGrow`, are handled by a different part of the
code (figure 41.4).

```
 pub fn pricing_v1(op: &Operator, tys: &HashMap<SignatureIndex, FunctionType>) -> u64
 {
 …
 let ink = match op {
     {...omitted for brevity...}
     dot!(MemoryGrow) => 1, // cost handled by memory pricer
```

_Figure 41.1: Part of the_ _`pricing_v1`_ _function that defers the ink price for_ _`MemoryGrow`_ _to the_

_memory pricer_


However, if a WASM program has fixed memory (and therefore does not import the `pay`
function), the cost of the opcode will be unmodified (figure 41.2).

```
 impl<'a> FuncMiddleware<'a> for FuncHeapBound {
   fn feed<O>(&mut self, op: Operator<'a>, out: &mut O) -> Result<()>
   where
     O: Extend<Operator<'a>>,
   {
     use Operator::*;

     let Some(pay_func) = self.pay_func else {
        out.extend([op]);
        return Ok(());
     };
```

_Figure 41.2: The header of the_ _`feed`_ _function of the_ _`FuncHeapBound`_ _middleware_


A call to `MemoryGrow` for a program with a fixed memory returns `-1`, which is correct
according to the WASM standard. Unfortunately, the price of that opcode will be 1 ink,
<u>which is too small to cover the actual cost of the operation in a WASM execution.</u>

Exploit Scenario
Eve crafts a malicious WASM program that repeatedly triggers the `MemoryGrow` opcode in a
WASM program that has a fixed memory in order to exhaust the resources of the
validators. Due to the low cost of the `MemoryGrow` opcode on programs with a fixed
memory, she pays a minimal amount of ink to carry out the attack.


Recommendations
Short term, increase the cost of the `MemoryGrow` opcode to make sure it is sufficient for all
programs, including those with fixed memory.


Long term, perform fuzz testing of the processes for validating, activating, and executing
WASM contracts.

## D. Code Quality Findings

#### Rust Code

  - Some areas of the code write values to WASM memory (e.g., `block_coinbase` ),
while other areas read values (e.g., `block_gas_limit` ). The need to write values in
those cases is unclear.

```
 pub(crate) fn block_coinbase<E: EvmApi>(mut env: WasmEnvMut<E>, ptr: u32) ->
 MaybeEscape {
   let mut env = WasmEnv::start(&mut env, PTR_INK)?;
   env.write_bytes20(ptr, env.evm_data.block_coinbase)?;
   trace!("block_coinbase", env, &[], env.evm_data.block_coinbase)
 }
 pub(crate) fn block_gas_limit<E: EvmApi>(mut env: WasmEnvMut<E>) -> Result<u64,
 Escape> {
   let mut env = WasmEnv::start(&mut env, 0)?;
   let limit = env.evm_data.block_gas_limit;
   trace!("block_gas_limit", env, &[], be!(limit), limit)
 }
```

```
   arbitrator/wasm-libraries/user-host-trait/src/lib.rs#L665–L682

```

  - The `contractCallImpl` function’s `evmGas` variable (figure D.2) is overwritten in the
`contract_call` function (figure D.3), which can lead to confusion.

```
 func contractCallImpl(api usize, contract bytes20, data *rustSlice, evmGas *u64,
 value bytes32, len *u32) apiStatus {
     closures := getApi(api)
     ret_len, cost, err := closures.contractCall(contract.toAddress(), data.read(),
 uint64(*evmGas), value.toBig())
     *evmGas = u64(cost) // evmGas becomes the call's cost
     *len = u32(ret_len)
     if err != nil {
         return apiFailure
     }
     return apiSuccess
 }
```

 - Functions do not always have the same ordering of return arguments (e.g.,
`static_call` and `create1` ), which is an error-prone coding practice.


```
fn static_call(

```

```

  contract: Bytes20,
  calldata: &[u8],
  gas: u64,
) -> (u32, u64, UserOutcomeKind) {

  (return_data_len, call_gas, api_status.into())
}

```

```
fn create1(

```

```

  endowment: Bytes32,
  gas: u64,
) -> (Result<Bytes20>, u32, u64) {

 - Some operations that can panic are undocumented. Additionally, some operations
use `unwrap` instead of `expect` (e.g., `universal_test` ), so reasons for erroring are
unclear.

```
pub fn universal_test(_attr: TokenStream, item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
   let item_clone = item.clone();
   let mut iter = item_clone.into_iter();
   let _ = iter.next().unwrap(); // fn

}

should be `offset` .

 - Programs are currently not forced to be reactivated if a change in the Stylus version
is detected during program execution; this could be used as a way to bypass the
important system invariant that contracts being executed should have been
activated under the current version. For instance, if the Stylus version is upgraded
from a smart contract (e.g., a multisignature wallet or a DAO), then when the call to
`ArbOwner` to set a new Stylus version returns, the contract under execution was
never activated under the current version.


 - The `RETURN_DATA_COPY` host I/O operation does not error out when reading out of
bounds. The EVM equivalent will revert if `offsite + size` overflows or if `offsite +`
`size` is greater than `len(return_data)` ; this is a divergence that can lead to user
mistakes.

## F. Toward an Automated Fuzzing Process

For this engagement, we created a fuzz test that uses `[bolero](https://github.com/camshaft/bolero)`, an in-process,
coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing engine that works with Rust code. This test covers
the parsing and processing of WASM programs, which take untrusted inputs. We integrated
the fuzz test into the tests of the `arbitrator/stylus` crate (i.e., added a new test to
`tests/native.rs` ). Figure F.1 shows the first part of the `fuzz_wasm` test:

```

   bolero::check!().for_each(|data: &[u8]| {

    let exports_test_case = r#"
     (module
          (func (export "user_entrypoint") (param i32) (result i32)
          unreachable
          )
     )
     "#;
    let available_imports = r#"

```

```

      (import "vm_hooks" "write_result" (func $write_result (param i32 i32)))
      (import "vm_hooks" "exit_early" (func $exit (param i32)))
      (import "vm_hooks" "msg_value" (func $msg_value (param

```

    let wasm_imports = wat::parse_str(available_imports).unwrap();

    let mut unstructured = Unstructured::new(data);
    let mut config = Config::arbitrary(&mut unstructured).expect("arbitrary
config");
    config.min_funcs = 1;
    config.max_funcs = 5;
    config.max_memories = 1;
    config.min_memories = 1;
    config.bulk_memory_enabled = false;

```

```
    config.multi_value_enabled = false;
    config.exports = Some(wasm_exports.clone());
    config.available_imports = Some(wasm_imports.clone());
    …
```

_Figure F.1: The header of the fuzz test_


In order to run the test efficiently, Stylus needs well-formed WASM binaries. The use of raw
bytes to feed the fuzzer is absolutely impractical because WASM modules have rather strict
constraints. Therefore, we decided to use `wasm-smith` to craft valid WASM binaries. While
we could have used the vanilla version of the tool, the results would not have been good
because the WASM binaries need certain imports and exports that vanilla `wasm-smith`
[would have been extremely unlikely to include by chance. Therefore, we had to fork](https://github.com/ggrieco-tob/wasm-tools)
`[wasm-smith](https://github.com/ggrieco-tob/wasm-tools)` to add a few small features.


Once a module is properly created, native execution is used to quickly run the binary:

```
    if let Ok(module) = Module::new(config, &mut unstructured) {
    let wasm_bytes = module.to_bytes();
    let mut file_native = NamedTempFile::new().unwrap();
    file_native.write_all(&wasm_bytes).unwrap();
    file_native.flush().unwrap();

    let mut compile = my_test_compile_config(false);
    let config = my_uniform_cost_config();
    if let Ok(mut native) =
 NativeInstance::new_linked(file_native.path().display().to_string(), &compile,
 config) {
      let ink = 1_000_000;
      native.set_meter_data();
      native.set_ink(ink);
      let args = vec![1];
      run_native(&mut native, &args, ink);

```

_Figure F.2: Native execution of the WASM binary_


Finally, after native execution, the WASM binary can be run in prover mode:

```
 let mut file_machine = NamedTempFile::new().unwrap();
 file_machine.write_all(&wat.as_bytes()).unwrap();
 file_machine.flush().unwrap();

 let maybe_machine = Machine::from_user_path(file_machine.path(), &compile);
 match maybe_machine {
  Ok(mut machine) => {
  run_machine(&mut machine, &args, config, ink);
  check_instrumentation(native, machine);
  }
  Err(err) => {
     println!("{}", err);

```

```
  }
 }
```

_Figure F.3: Prover execution of the binary_


This part of the fuzzing test is very slow (with single executions usually taking around 20
seconds). The produced binaries to test are small, so we suspect that most of the
processing time comes from the processing and conversion of libraries (e.g., soft float
libraries). This code will also check that the native and instrumented machine consumes
the same amount of ink and memory stacks.


With all these steps completed, the fuzzer can then be run using the following command:

```
$ cargo bolero test test::native::fuzz_wasm -s NONE

```

After the build finishes, `bolero` will immediately start running the fuzzing campaign. ASan
can be enabled by removing `-s NONE` from the command, but this results in slower
execution times and may trigger some crashes from Wasmer (e.g., TOB-STYLUS-8,
TOB-STYLUS-9).


When this command is used, `bolero` will run for as long as needed until it triggers a failure.
We recommend monitoring the values on screen to make sure the fuzzer explores as many
code paths as possible.


Note that this fuzzer will not directly use the coverage provided by the execution of the
WASM code compiled as native. Instead, it will use the coverage of the underlying Rust
implementation. Coverage of the compiled WASM code will have to be implemented in
order to inspect it and to increase the effectiveness of the fuzzing campaign.

#### Recommendations

The testing code needs to be refactored to be as close as possible to the production code.
In that regard, we have a few recommended changes:


  - The use of native execution during testing fails to validate WASM binaries as part of
the instrumentation executed during activation of the binaries. This results in
divergences in executions when the native execution contains an unsupported
WASM feature (e.g., vectorized operations). Make sure the validation after activation
is performed exactly the same for different modes.


  - The test’s prover execution code uses the `user-test` library instead of the
production code. It should be changed to use the production code so that it more
closely matches the implementation.


  - The testing code also contains some testing code related to EVM handling (e.g.,
calling another contract). This code should be changed to use the equivalent from


Trail of Bits 125 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


the production code. While it is not critical to have the same behavior, using as
much of the production code as possible is useful for finding issues in Stylus.


Moving forward, we recommend that Offchain implement a “fuzzer-friendly mode” that
avoids performing very CPU-intensive operations that can be skipped during a fuzzing
campaign.


Additionally, consider adapting specific WASM tools such as `[xsmith](https://gitlab.flux.utah.edu/xsmith/webassembly-sandbox/)` in order to trigger
more interesting and complex behavior that `wasm-smith` cannot easily reach, particularly
for testing optimized code.

#### Integrating Fuzzing and Coverage Measurement into the Development Cycle

Once the fuzzing procedure has been tuned to be fast and efficient, it should be properly
integrated into the development cycle to catch bugs. We recommend adopting the
following procedure to integrate fuzzing using a CI system:


1. After the initial fuzzing campaign, save the corpora that is generated for every test.


2. For every internal development milestone, new feature, or public release, rerun the
fuzzing campaign for at least 24 hours starting with the current corpora for each
test.


3. Update the corpora with the new inputs generated.


Note that, over time, the corpora will come to represent thousands of CPU hours of
refinement and will be very valuable for guiding efficient code coverage during fuzz testing.
However, an attacker could also use them to quickly identify vulnerable code. To mitigate
this risk, we recommend keeping the fuzzing corpora in an access-controlled storage
location rather than a public repository. Some CI systems allow maintainers to keep a
cache to accelerate building and testing. The corpora could be included in such a cache if
[they are not very large. For more on fuzz-driven development, see the CppCon 2017 talk](https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017/blob/master/Demos/Fuzz%20Or%20Lose/Fuzz%20Or%20Lose%20-%20Kostya%20Serebryany%20-%20CppCon%202017.pdf)

## G. Recommendations for Improving Integration Tests

In this appendix, we provide recommendations for making improvements to the tests
found in `system_tests/program_tests.go` and for including additional test cases. Note
that additional assertions may need to be performed in some of the test cases to cover all
edge cases.


**●** **The test** **`“Checking success (Rust => Solidity => Rust)”`** **should assert the**
**following:**


    - A single transaction was executed.


    - Two internal transactions were executed.


    - The transaction returned the expected Keccak data.


**●** **Add a test to ensure that static call properties are preserved (Solidity => Stylus**
**=> Solidity):**


    - Have a Solidity contract perform a static call into a Stylus program.


    - Have the Stylus program call another Solidity contract that tries to modify the
state.


    - Verify that a revert occurs during the Stylus program’s call to the other
Solidity contract.


An additional version of this test could perform a write to storage within the Stylus
program instead of calling into Solidity.


Note that a test case already exists from the Stylus counterpart.


**●** **Add a test to ensure that the self-destruct opcode cannot be used to destroy**
**Stylus programs (Stylus => Solidity).** Stylus programs cannot contain the
self-destruct opcode; however, they use `delegatecall`, which could make
self-destruction possible:


    - Have a Stylus program call `delegatecall` on a Solidity program to
self-destruct the Stylus program.


    - Have the test ensure that the Stylus program is no longer callable and that it
no longer has code.


    - Have the test verify that the Stylus program cannot be reactivated.


[Consider using EIP-6780 for this test.](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6780)


Trail of Bits 127 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


Note that additional test cases could verify that the Stylus program that has been
self-destructed is still callable within the same transaction.


**●** **Add a test for** **`delegatecall`** **functionality (Solidity => Stylus && Stylus =>**
**Solidity):**


   - Create a program with some values in its storage and have it call
`delegatecall` on a program of a different kind (e.g., Stylus or Solidity) that
reads those values from the storage and returns them.


   - Have the test check that the returned values match the expected ones.


**●** **Add a test to ensure that low-level Solidity call properties are preserved**
**(Solidity => Stylus && Stylus => Solidity):**


   - Have a Solidity contract perform a low-level call to a Stylus program with no
code. The test should ensure that the low-level call succeeds.


   - Have a Stylus program perform a low-level call to a Solidity program with no
code or EOA. The test should ensure that the call succeeds.


**●** **Add a test to determine whether destroyed programs can be redeployed with**
**`CREATE2`** **(Solidity || Stylus => Stylus => Solidity):**


   - Have a Solidity (or Stylus) contract deploy a new Stylus program through
`CREATE2` .


   - Have the newly created Solidity (or Stylus) program call `delegatecall` on a
Solidity contract to execute the self-destruct opcode on itself.


   - Have the test repeat the first step to verify that the self-destructed program
can be redeployed.


   - Have the test ensure the contract is callable after the redeployment.


[Consider using EIP-6780 for this test.](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6780)


- **Add tests to ensure reasons for reverts are preserved across environments**
**(Stylus => Solidity && Solidity => Stylus):**


   - Have a Stylus program perform calls to a Solidity program, and have those
calls revert for different reasons (e.g., panic due to overflow, panic due to
out-of-bounds read) and in different ways (e.g., a string stating the reason, a
custom error). Have the test ensure that those errors are correctly preserved
by returning them and comparing them against their expected values. Create
the same test case for a Solidity program calling a Stylus program.


**●** **<u>Add various tests to check out-of-gas/ink cases such as the following:</u>**


Trail of Bits 128 Arbitrum Stylus Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


**○** From Rust directly


**○** From Rust calling to Rust


**○** From Solidity calling to Rust


**○** From Solidity calling to Rust calling to Rust again


**○** From Rust calling to Solidity calling to Rust


**○** From Rust calling to Solidity calling to Rust and calling to Rust again


**●** **Add a test of the stack frame limit:**


**○** The test should verify that the stack depth for Solidity programs will never
exceed 1,023 when called by a Stylus program. Starting from a Stylus
program, have the program call a Solidity contract, which would then call the
Stylus program, and so on.


**○** The test should fail if the stack depth exceeds 1,023 Solidity frames.
