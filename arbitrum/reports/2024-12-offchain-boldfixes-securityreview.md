#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of several pull requests (PRs) on
the Nitro contracts repository.


A team of three consultants conducted the review from December 12 to December 16,
2024, for a total of four engineer-days of effort. Our testing efforts focused on the changes
made by the PRs. With full access to source code and documentation, we performed a
manual review of the PRs. Additionally, on December 19, 2024, a team of two consultants
reviewed the BoLD upgrade actions payload and deployed contracts.

#### Observations and Impact

We identified no significant issues during the PR review. Most of the PRs have a small
scope, and their changes are properly identified. We found one issue that affects the
deployed contracts for executing the BoLD upgrade actions, highlighting that a more
accurate approach to deploying and verifying the contract should be taken.

#### Recommendations

Based on the findings identified during the security review, Trail of Bits recommends that
Offchain Labs take the following step:


  - **Remediate the findings disclosed in this report.** These findings should be
addressed as part of a direct remediation or as part of any refactor that may occur
when addressing other recommendations.

## Project Coverage

This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by
our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:


  - **[Upgrade instructions and PR 325](https://arbitrum.notion.site/Bold-2024-Dec-Diff-15701a3f59f8802b8886c1fea29335bd)** . We assessed whether the actions are executed
in the correct order and whether the new configuration values are as expected, that
the BoLD proposal payload data matches the script’s output, and that the deployed
action contracts are well configured.


  - **[PR 266](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/266)** . We checked the effects on the validators to, for example, determine the
state after the proposal execution (e.g., if users can withdraw). We also checked how
the old rollup is used and its interactions with the upgraded and new contracts.


  - **[PR 214](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/214)** : We looked at the overall contracts for flaws that would allow an attacker to
steal funds, withdraw more than deposited, bypass the access controls, or
compromise the bidding process.


  - **[PR 262](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/262)** : We reviewed the refactoring and looked for unexpected semantic changes.


  - **[PR 263](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/263)** : We reviewed the improvements and the additional checks for correctness.


  - **[PR 250](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/250)** : We reviewed the need for zero transfer checks in the other contracts.


  - **[PR 230](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/230)** : We reviewed the gas optimization to assess correct variable usage.


  - **[PR 270](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/270)** : We reviewed the refactoring. While we briefly examined the impact of
removing the checks, we have not assessed the impact on the broader codebase.


  - **[PR 265](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/265)** : We reviewed the salt addition to determine if it prevents the risk of
front-running.


  - **[PR 275](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/275)** : We assessed whether the delay proof is disabled and not required, and
whether it can still be submitted.

## Detailed Findings

1. Out-of-order event risk due to reentrancy


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-NITRO-PR-001


Target: `express-lane-auction/ExpressLaneAuction.sol`


Description
A reentrancy can occur when tokens are transferred, and may cause the express lane to
emit events in the wrong order.


A recurring pattern in the express lane contracts is to transfer tokens, and then emit an
event:

```
 function finalizeWithdrawal() external {
   uint256 amountReduced =
     _balanceOf[msg.sender].finalizeWithdrawal(roundTimingInfo.currentRound());
   biddingToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amountReduced);
   emit WithdrawalFinalized(msg.sender, amountReduced);
 }
```

_Figure 1.1:_ _`ExpressLaneAuction.sol#L312-L317`_


If the bidding token has a callback mechanism on transfer, this pattern may allow a
malicious actor to reenter the contract and perform some actions that will emit events. This
will cause the overall order of the event emission to be incorrect.


While there is no direct on-chain risk, it may complicate third-party integration.


Exploit Scenario
The bidding token allows for arbitrary callbacks on transfers. Eve calls
`finalizeWithdrawal` . During the token transfer, the execution reenters, and Eve makes a
deposit and then initiates a new withdrawal. As a result of the transaction execution, the
contract emits the following events:


  - `Deposit`


  - `WithdrawalInitiated`


  - <u>`WithdrawalFinalized`</u>


Trail of Bits 9 Offchain Labs BoLD Fixes Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


The last event is associated with the withdrawal created in the previous block. This
out-of-order event emission perturbs the monitoring tool.


Recommendations
Short term, emit the event before the token transfer or document the associated risks for
the bidding token.


Long term, document the known reentrancy risks and the constraints associated with the
tokens the contracts interact with.

2. Express lane design is unnecessarily complex


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-NITRO-PR-002


Target: `express-lane-auction/ExpressLaneAuction.sol`


Description
The express lane contracts have a lot of unnecessary complexity. This complexity increases
the risks and the likelihood of mistakes in case of code updates. Below we provide general
design recommendations.


  - **Use a special value for uninitialized rounds.** Currently, the zero value has a
double meaning: it is either the round zero or the uninitialized state. This dual state
could complicate third-party integration. For example, `resolvedRounds` will return
the round zero as being already resolved when the system is deployed:

```
 /// @inheritdoc IExpressLaneAuction
 function resolvedRounds() external view returns (ELCRound memory, ELCRound memory) {
   return latestResolvedRounds[0].round > latestResolvedRounds[1].round
     ? (latestResolvedRounds[0], latestResolvedRounds[1])
     : (latestResolvedRounds[1], latestResolvedRounds[0]);
 }
```

_Figure 2.1:_ _`ExpressLaneAuction.sol#L561-L566`_


**●** **Do not use a signed type for** **`offsetTimestamp`** **.** This makes the manipulation
more complex than it should be. Given that it is a direct offset (and not a sliding
value), there is no need for a negative value.


  - **Consider merging** **`resolveSingleBidAuction`** **and resolveMultiBidAuction** . The
trust assumption is that `AUCTIONEER_ROLE` is trusted, so there is no need to put the
second-highest bid on-chain. If the user with the `AUCTIONEER_ROLE` is malicious, he
can set up a fake account with any second bid value. While having two functions to
resolve the bid eases the monitoring/tracking, it increases the attack surface. A
different design would be to have one function, and let the auctioneer specify the
second-highest bid directly (which would be the reserve in case of a single bid).


Recommendations
Short term, consider implementing the recommendations highlighted above.


Trail of Bits 11 Offchain Labs BoLD Fixes Security Assessment

Long term, carefully review what information needs to be put on-chain and what are the
trust assumptions before implementing any contract.

3. Validator added to Arb1 instead of Nova


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-NITRO-PR-003


Target: BoLD upgrade actions


Description
The BoLD upgrade actions are a set of actions that will be eventually executed by a
privileged address to upgrade BoLD.


Each action is a smart contract with a `perform` function that implements one well-defined
job. In particular, the last action is to add a new validator
(0x0fF813f6BD577c3D1cDbE435baC0621BE6aE34B4) for Nova (figure 3.1). The action
[contract is deployed at address 0x2f845d909058200e4E56855C2735975a004a4922.](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2f845d909058200e4E56855C2735975a004a4922)

```
 pragma solidity 0.8.16;

 import "../address-registries/interfaces.sol";

 contract SetValidatorsAction {
   IRollupGetter public immutable addressRegistry;

   constructor(IRollupGetter _addressRegistry) {
     addressRegistry = _addressRegistry;
   }

   function perform(address[] calldata _validators, bool[] calldata _values)
 external {
     IRollupAdmin(address(addressRegistry.rollup())).setValidator(_validators,
 _values);
   }
 }
```

_Figure 3.1: The_ _`SetValidatorsAction`_ _contract_


The `perform` function is simple and will call the `setValidator` function of the rollup
address returned by the `addressRegistry` [. The problem is with the address that was set](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2f845d909058200e4E56855C2735975a004a4922#readContract#F1)
as the `addressRegistry` variable during deployment. The address is
[0xd514C2b3aaBDBfa10800B9C96dc1eB25427520A0, which represents the address registry](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd514C2b3aaBDBfa10800B9C96dc1eB25427520A0)
for Arb1 and not Nova; this means that the validator will be added to Arb1 instead of Nova.

Exploit Scenario
The BoLD upgrade actions payload is proposed to the DAO and passes. It gets executed,
and the validator is added to Arb1 instead of Nova.


Recommendations
Short term, deploy a new `SetValidatorsAction` with the correct `addressRegistry`
variable set to Nova (Nova address registry:
[0x2F06643fc2CC18585Ae790b546388F0DE4Ec6635). Otherwise, reuse a deployed](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2F06643fc2CC18585Ae790b546388F0DE4Ec6635)
`SetValidatorsAction` contract with the `addressRegistry` already set to Nova at the
[following address: 0xbf94afebfbf062a88615bc012da39d0822670aba.](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbf94afebfbf062a88615bc012da39d0822670aba)


Long term, due to the sensitivity of these actions, at least two people should review the
contracts to ensure that they have the correct configuration set, even when they are
deployed through script.
