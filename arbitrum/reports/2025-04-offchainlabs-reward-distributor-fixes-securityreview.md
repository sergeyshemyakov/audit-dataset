## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the changes made to the
reward distributor contract to support handling of ERC-20 tokens specified at deployment
[(e.g., WETH). These changes correspond to PR #44 (](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts/pull/44) `fafc251` ).


The commits in scope involve a number of changes that allow reward distributor contracts
to use ERC-20 tokens to properly reimburse the data availability committee members.
Essentially, a set of addresses are paid based on a formula that is computed on-chain (the
formula was not modified in the changes in scope). Only the infrastructure smart
contract–related changes were in scope, so testing and deployment code was excluded.


A team of four consultants conducted the review from April 7 to April 8, 2025, for a total of
four engineer-days of effort. With full access to source code and documentation, we
performed a manual review of the code in scope.

#### Observations and Impact

This engagement did not reveal any issues in the code in scope. However, we provide some
recommendations for improving the code quality in the Code Quality Recommendations
appendix.

#### Recommendations

Based on the security review, Trail of Bits recommends that Offchain Labs take the
following step:


●​ Review the items in the Code Quality Recommendations appendix and consider
taking action on each one.

## A. Code Quality Recommendations

The following is a list of findings that were not identified as immediate security issues but
may warrant further investigation.


●​ **Consider adding documentation on the preconditions for the funds**
**distribution.** For example, the following should be documented:


○​ When new recipients are added, the list is not checked for duplicate
recipients.


○​ When new recipients are added, their assigned weights are not checked to
ensure they are nonzero.


While it is assumed that these checks are performed off-chain and the admin is
trusted, the contract code could include some documentation about them.


**●​** **Consider correcting the following typos:**


○​ `recieve` should be changed to `receive` .

#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.
