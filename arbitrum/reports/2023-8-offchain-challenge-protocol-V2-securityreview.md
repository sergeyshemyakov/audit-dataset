#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the new version of Arbitrum
Chains’ Challenge Protocol. This new version introduces several fundamental changes to
the protocol to mitigate the delay attack scenarios the previous version was weak to.


A team of two consultants conducted the review from March 27 to April 21, from May 1 to
May 5, and from May 15 to June 16, for a total of 20 engineer-weeks of effort. Our testing
efforts focused on the review of the new challenge protocol implementation. With full
access to source code and documentation, we performed static and dynamic testing of the
system, using automated and manual processes.


It is worth mentioning that we reviewed the project as it was being developed, and each
week the scope of the review shifted based on the new developments. While this allowed
us to give more actionable feedback each week, it also meant that we often reviewed code
that was still a work in progress.

#### Observations and Impact

We found that the off-chain systems’ decision making did not rely on the smart contract
errors and state. This caused most of the issues related to the off-chain components,
including TOB-ARBCH-29 and TOB-ARBCH-17, which caused unexpected behavior in the
finite state machine implementation. Additionally, other issues related to a lack of thorough
testing (TOB-ARBCH-20 and TOB-ARBCH-19), although these were remediated as the review
advanced and development continued. Note that the off-chain components are still a work
in progress.


On the on-chain side, our findings were mostly related to duplicated code or possible
optimizations (TOB-ARBCH-8, TOB-ARBCH-10). The smart contracts are architectured using
a bottom-up approach, in which the libraries offer the core functionality that the
higher-level contracts then rely on (especially in the edge-related contacts and libraries).
This contributed to successful development and helped us review the implementations
with a relatively high degree of isolation. However, the assumptions for the
assertion-related contracts (rollup), especially around assertion creation and the
interactions with the inbox contract, were not as clear. Additionally, the documentation of
on-chain components was not thorough. In these contracts, we identified some
inconsistencies and unclear behavior (TOB-ARBCH-31, TOB-ARBCH-34).

**PUBLIC**


Finally, certain aspects of the system related to incentives for honest and dishonest actors
are not yet completely clear, which may contribute to griefing attacks through
front-running (TOB-ARBCH-19). These risks should be thoroughly documented.

#### Recommendations

Based on the codebase maturity evaluation and findings identified during the security
review, Trail of Bits recommends that Offchain Labs take the following steps:


  - **Remediate the findings disclosed in this report.** These findings should be
addressed as part of a direct remediation or as part of any refactor that may occur
when addressing other recommendations.


  - **Expand and formalize documentation.** The documentation around the rollup
contracts should be expanded, particularly assertion creation and the interactions
with the broader Arbitrum technology (e.g., the inbox). Additionally, all the
documentation that was provided during the review should be formalized and
expanded.


**●** **Create an incident response plan.** Because the challenge protocol is a critical
component of the Arbitrum technology, it is of utmost importance that suspicious
behavior is swiftly identified and, in the case that the off-chain system fails, there
are alternatives in place to continue advancing the chain (for example, manually
calling the challenge contracts). Creating an incident response plan that outlines
how the Offchain Labs team should react in such cases will enable quick action.


**●** **Continue the development of the off-chain system with our findings and**
**recommendations in mind.** Using the findings and recommendations presented in
this document will help the Offchain Labs team to identify and fix potential issues
during development.


**●** **Improve testing.** While the testing for the smart contracts was very thorough, the
tests present in the off-chain system were not (as highlighted by some of our
findings). Improving both the unit and integration tests will help identify unexpected
behavior. Consider deploying the new challenge protocol in a test environment and
testing the off-chain system with “abnormal” situations (for example, front-running
the validator), as this will help identify unexpected behavior.


Finally, consider implementing automated testing, such as fuzzing.

## Project Goals

The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of the Arbitrum chains
challenge protocol v2. Specifically, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list of
questions:


  - Does the challenge protocol implementation respect the specification?


  - Do the Solidity and Go implementations have the same behavior?


  - Can an attacker win a challenge with an invalid state?


  - Can an attacker DoS the challenge protocol?


  - Can an honest actor always win a challenge within a certain bounded time?


  - Can a staker withdraw their stake if the assertion’s staked won?


  - Can the stake be stolen?

## Project Coverage

This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by
our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:


  - **Proof Utilities** . The Solidity and Go implementations of utilities check for prefix and
inclusion proof verification; additionally, the Go side can generate those proofs. We
assessed whether both implementations have the same behavior and respect the
specifications, and that the Go implementation does not have unhandled panics.


  - **Challenge Edge** . A challenge is divided into sub-challenges: Block, BigStep, and
SmallStep. During these sub-challenges, actors who disagree about the state of the
L2 bisect their claims (edges) until they reach an edge of length one that they
disagree on; once that length-one edge is reached, actors can generate a proof of
the correctness of their edge and confirm it. This part of the system is mainly
composed of two Solidity libraries: `EdgeChallengeManagerLib.sol` and
`ChallengeEdgeLib.sol` . They allow the creation of new edges and their own
confirmation in four different ways: by time, by children, by claim, and by a one-step
proof. We reviewed these for the correct implementation of the specification
regarding creation, tracking unrivaled edge time, and that only valid states can be
confirmed.


  - **Edge Tracker** . Part of the off-chain software (validator) to interact with the smart
contracts, the Edge Tracker keeps track of the edges created and their own state
transitions until an eventual confirmation. We reviewed the finite state machine for
the correct state transitions compared to the specifications; whether a malicious
actor can put the tracker in an undefined state; whether the validator software will
always arrive to an end; and whether denial-of-service attack vectors are possible
through front-running.


  - **Challenge Watcher** . The Challenge Watcher is a singleton service available to all of
the spawned Edge Trackers. It tracks common information, such as the edges’
ancestors and an edge’s unrivaled time. We reviewed the Challenge Watcher for
possible issues, such as edges not tracked and erroneous computation of the
unrivaled time of the ancestors.


  - **Assertion Chain (Rollup)** . This is the main entrypoint of the challenge protocol, to
which validators submit their commitments to an L2 state history (e.g., assertions) to
initiate a challenge period. These contracts manage the creation of new assertions
along with the validator staking. We reviewed the assertion creation functionality,

**PUBLIC**


staking, and confirmation, ensuring that these are consistent with the available
documentation and specification. We made sure that once an assertion is confirmed
(signaling the end of a challenge), no other assertions can ever be confirmed for that
challenge.

#### Coverage Limitations

Because of the time-boxed nature of testing work, it is common to encounter coverage
limitations. The following list outlines the coverage limitations of the engagement and
indicates system elements that may warrant further review:


  - Some of the smart contracts are meant to be used through a proxy architecture.
However, these proxies were not part of the scope of the review, and therefore we
cannot speak to the correctness of the system when integrated with them.


  - Familiarizing ourselves with the new challenge protocol specification (i.e., the
whitepaper and the different proofs defined in it) was a very important part of the
engagement, and we did not identify any flaws in the specification. However,
ensuring the correctness of all the proofs presented in the whitepaper was not the
main focus of the review, and as a result, the proofs may warrant further review
(e.g., through a focused peer review of the paper).


  - The off-chain system is still a work in progress, and we were able to review only
certain parts of it (e.g., the Edge Tracker and Challenge Watcher). As a result, it may
warrant further review once it is completed.


  - We did not review the economic incentives of the protocol; additionally, these are
still unclear, as highlighted in TOB-ARBCH-15.


  - We reviewed the challenge protocol only as an isolated component; we did not
review its integration with the broader Arbitrum technology.

## Codebase Maturity Evaluation

Trail of Bits uses a traffic-light protocol to provide each client with a clear understanding of
the areas in which its codebase is mature, immature, or underdeveloped. Deficiencies
identified here often stem from root causes within the software development life cycle that
should be addressed through standardization measures (e.g., the use of common libraries,
functions, or frameworks) or training and awareness programs.


**Category** **Summary** **Result**



Arithmetic Arithmetic operations used across the codebase (both in
the on and off-chain code) are very simple in nature (e.g.,
summation); additionally, they are all documented as
part of the challenge protocol specification described in
the whitepaper.


No overflow risk was detected on the smart contracts, as
they rely on Solidity’s 0.8 native overflow protection.
Additionally, all arithmetic operations involve timers
using block numbers and are upper-bounded by the
challenge period.


Note that while the off-chain system is still a work in
progress, we did identify some potential type-casting
risks (TOB-ARBCH-25).


Auditing On the smart contract side, all critical state-changing
operations emit events. Additionally, on the off-chain
components, there are several instances of error logging
operations that will help the Offchain Labs team identify
suspicious behavior. Note, however, that we have
reviewed only some parts of the off-chain system and
that it is still a work in progress.


Finally, because the challenge protocol is a
mission-critical component of the Arbitrum technology, it
is very important that any suspicious behavior is
identified and solved as quickly as possible and that, in

the case that the off-chain system fails to consistently
advance the challenge, there are other alternatives in
place to ensure the network’s safety (e.g., manually
calling the challenge contracts).


While the Offchain labs team has mentioned these
alternative mechanisms, at least informally during the
engagement, we recommend formalizing them in the
form of an incident response plan (see appendix D for
some recommendations on how to build such a plan).


While most of the externally exposed functions found in
the smart contracts have no access controls, some
instances of protected functions correctly implement
access controls. However, the identity of those privileged
actors is sometimes unclear (e.g., who is the validator).


Additionally, when it comes to the “validator role,” the
smart contracts allow the validator allowlist to be
disabled when the validator becomes “AFK.” We
recommend expanding documentation around this
specific workflow, as the inline documentation, in its
current state, is not enough to reason about it.


We recommend that the Offchain Labs team lead a
documentation effort regarding who the privileged
actors are and what their roles in the system are.


Finally, on the off-chain side, our review focused on the
internal components related to edge management; we
did not have a chance to review external-facing
components.


The fundamental idea behind the new protocol design,
which is outlined in the whitepaper, is relatively easy to
follow; additionally, the documentation that was
provided to us during each week of the review, coupled
with the way in which the edge-related contracts were
structured, made the system easier to understand and
enabled us to examine components with a relatively high
degree of isolation.

On the other hand, the smart contracts that interact with
the rest of the Arbitrum technology (e.g., the ones can be
found in the rollup folder) have a much higher degree of
complexity, as they interact with other parts of the
system (e.g., the inbox contract). The documentation
available to us regarding these contracts was not as
thorough as the previous ones. We recommend that the
Offchain Labs team lead a documentation effort for
these particular contracts, especially regarding
assumptions around assertion creation and the
interactions with the rest of the system.


On the off-chain side, while the complexity was higher (as
expected of an off-chain system), the addition of a finite
state machine for edge tracking, along with the provided
support documentation, made the system easier to
understand, as this very clearly captured the challenge
protocol behavior. However, the off-chain system is still a
work in progress, and we have reviewed only certain
parts of it.


All in all, when taken in isolation, the system was
relatively easy to understand given the whitepaper
specification along with the chosen architecture and
supporting documentation. However, the parts of the
system that needed to interact with components of the
broader Arbitrum ecosystem have a higher degree of
complexity, and the assumptions around them are
unclear given that the available specification does not
touch on those interactions.


No cryptography or key management related
components were in the scope of the review.



Decentralization The new protocol design does not impact the
decentralization characteristics of the Arbitrum
technology.


Documentation We were provided with the new challenge protocol
whitepaper which, although mostly in a work-in-progress
version, contained all the necessary information for us to

understand the system along with the protocol
specification.


Additionally, each week, with the exception of the last
one, we were provided with thorough documentation
describing the part of the system we would be reviewing
and some of the assumptions. We recommend that the
Offchain Labs team formalize this documentation to
further help development and review.


Additionally, the documentation regarding the smart
contracts that manage assertion creation and interact
with other components of the Arbitrum technology
should be expanded.


Finally, there is a general lack of formal documentation
about competition between the actors that interact with
the system to advance the challenge and incentives for
those actors (e.g., whether honest actors will be
refunded for their work). The Offchain Labs team did
provide some informal feedback about the existence of
these incentives, but we recommend leading a formal
documentation effort in this direction.


While we identified some instances of front-running risk
(TOB-ARBCH-17, TOB-ARBCH-29) in earlier versions of the
off-chain system, these were solved in subsequent
versions as the code matured. However, note that the
off-chain system is still a work in progress, and we were
able to cover only parts of it; it may warrant further
review as it is developed.


Additionally, on the on-chain side, there still exists risk of
griefing attacks through front-running (TOB-ARBCH-15);
however, the severity of these attacks solely depends on
some of the system’s assumptions regarding competition
between actors and how gas refunds may work for
honest actions, and these assumptions are still unclear.

Testing and
Verification



On the off-chain side, because we were reviewing code
that was still a work in progress, the tests were often not
fully complete, as highlighted in some of our findings
(TOB-ARBCH-20, TOB-ARBCH-19). However, these issues
were remediated as the review progressed.


Although the off-chain system is still a work in progress,
we recommend improving both unit and integration
tests. We also recommend using the new challenge
protocol in a testing environment and trying to create
different “abnormal” situations (e.g., front-running the
validator) to help identify unexpected behavior.


On the on-chain side, the available unit tests were very
thorough, testing both positive and negative cases.


Finally, the Offchain Labs team should consider
implementing automated testing techniques such as
fuzzing (there is some fuzzing already implemented for
the proof utilities).

## Detailed Findings

1. Go Root function does not check for an empty Merkle expansion


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-1


Target: `util/prefix-proofs/prefix_proofs.go`


Description
The Go `Root` function does not check if the Merkle expansion is empty, but the Solidity
counterpart does (figure 1.1).

```
 // The root of the subtree. A collision free commitment to the contents of the tree.
 // The root of a tree is defined as the cumulative hashing of the roots of
 // all its subtrees. Returns error for empty tree.
 func Root(me []common.Hash) (common.Hash, error) {
     if uint64(len(me)) >= MAX_LEVEL {
         return common.Hash{}, ErrLevelTooHigh
     }

     var accum common.Hash
     for i := 0; i < len(me); i++ {
       ...
     }
     return accum, nil
 }
```

As shown in the figure above, the `Root` function will return the empty hash when the input
is an empty Merkle expansion; however, as shown below, its Solidity counterparty will
revert.

```
 function root(bytes32[] memory me) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
   require(me.length > 0, "Empty merkle expansion");
   require(me.length <= MAX_LEVEL, "Merkle expansion too large");
   ...
```

Trail of Bits 23 Arbitrum Chains Challenge Protocol v2 Assessment

**PUBLIC**


Given the code comment highlighted in figure 1, the Go implementation is also expected to
return an error for an empty tree, which is not the case.


Exploit Scenario
The Challenge protocol is developed based on the assumption that both the Solidity and
Go implementations of the Merkle expansion’s `Root` function will throw an error whenever
an empty Merkle expansion is used as an input.


However, the Go implementation simply returns the empty hash. As a result, some actions
that should have been rejected early by the protocol will make it further into the challenge.


Recommendations
Short term, validate that the Merkle expansion is not empty in the Go `Root` function.


Long term, thoroughly document the divergent behavior and the expected behavior. The
codebase would benefit from the implementation of property testing by first creating a list
of properties that each function would need to enforce; using unit tests to validate those
properties; and, finally, expanding the fuzz tests using those properties as a baseline.

2. Go Root function does not accept Merkle expansion of MAX_LEVEL length


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-2


Target: `util/prefix-proofs/prefix_proofs.go`


Description
The Go `Root` function returns an error when the Merkle expansion’s length is equal to
`MAX_LEVEL` . However, the Solidity counterpart accepts that case. As a consequence, the
two behaviors differ.


```
func Root(me []common.Hash) (common.Hash, error) {

```

```
if uint64(len(me)) >= MAX_LEVEL {

```

```
    return common.Hash{}, ErrLevelTooHigh
}

```

As shown in the figure above, attempts to calculate the root of a max-level Merkle
expansion will return an error in the Go implementation, whereas the Solidity
implementation, shown below, will proceed with the calculation of the root.

```
 function root(bytes32[] memory me) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
    require(me.length > 0, "Empty merkle expansion");
    require(me.length <= MAX_LEVEL, "Merkle expansion too large");
```

As a result, the Go implementation will reject valid Merkle expansions.


Exploit Scenario
As a result of the divergent behavior, the challenge protocol rejects valid Merkle
expansions, potentially leading to unexpected behavior such as dishonest actors winning
the challenge.

Recommendations
Short term, in the Go `Root` function returns an error only if the Merkle expansion length is
greater than `MAX_LEVEL` not when it is equal.


Long term, thoroughly document the divergent behavior and the expected behavior. The
codebase would benefit from the implementation of property testing by first creating a list
of properties each function would need to enforce; using unit tests to validate those
properties; and finally expanding the fuzz tests using those properties as a baseline.

3. NewHistoryCommitment does not validate height


Severity: **Undetermined** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-3


Target: `util/commitments.go`


Description
The `NewHistoryCommitment` function does not validate the `height` argument, as
specified by the documentation (figure 3.1).

```
 In our implementation, we define the height of a history commitment as a 0-indexed
 height from the origin, and the size to be the number of leaves the commitment is
 for. That is, a history commitment of height 7 is committing to 8 leaves, i.e. [0,
 7]
```

_[Figure 3.1: Documentation for History Commitments](https://www.notion.so/arbitrum/History-Commitments-Proofs-6598fa4035e340f483b8d30670284bde?pvs=4#29f8ed7c25614491a161fd5eb3b08930)_


As shown in the snippet of documentation in figure 3.1, the `height` should be equal to
leaves’ length subtracted by 1. However, the `NewHistoryCommitment` function (figure 3.2)
does not have any check on the `height` argument.


```
// NewHistoryCommitment constructs a commitment from a height and list of leaves.
func NewHistoryCommitment(

```

```
    height uint64,
    leaves []common.Hash,
) (HistoryCommitment, error) {

```

```
if len(leaves) == 0 {

```

```
    return emptyCommit, errors.New("must commit to at least one leaf")
}
...

```


_Figure 3.2: Snippet of the_ _`NewHistoryCommitment`_ _function in_ _`[commitments.go#L53-L82](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/blob/a55f3547f3ef7ebe051b4ed5881f9928a8b4fb73/util/commitments.go#L53-L82)`_


Additionally, a test (figure 3.3) sets the height to the length of the leaves (note that this is
the same scenario given in the documentation example), and this passes due to the
missing validation.

```
 func TestHistoryCommitment_LeafProofs(t *testing.T) {
    leaves := make([]common.Hash, 8)
    for i := 0; i < len(leaves); i++ {

```

Trail of Bits 27 Arbitrum Chains Challenge Protocol v2 Assessment

**PUBLIC**


```
        leaves[i] = common.BytesToHash([]byte(fmt.Sprintf("%d", i)))
    }
    height := uint64(8)
    history, err := NewHistoryCommitment(height, leaves)
    ...
```

Recommendations
Short term, update the `NewHistoryCommitment` code to check that `height` `==`
`len(leaves)` `-` `1` ; alternatively, consider removing the height parameter altogether and
simply inferring the height out of the length of the leaves (i.e., `height` `=` `len(leaves)` `-`
`1` ).


Long term, thoroughly document the divergent behavior and the expected behavior. The
codebase would benefit from the implementation of property testing by first creating a list
of properties each function would need to enforce; using unit tests to validate those
properties; and finally expanding the fuzz tests using those properties as a baseline.

Recommendations
Short term, remove these errors if unused or apply the correct checks.

5. GeneratePrefixProof does not work in some cases


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-5


Target: `util/prefix-proofs/prefix_proofs.go`


Description
The `GeneratePrefixProof` function incorrectly returns an error when `yyy` is 0 and `zzz` is
not 0.


In the case that the `zzz` `!=` `0` branch is taken and `MostSignificantBit` is called with
`yyy` as an input, the function will return an `ErrCannotBeZero` error since `yyy` == 0.


```
func GeneratePrefixProof(

```

```
    prefixHeight uint64,
    prefixExpansion MerkleExpansion,
    leaves []common.Hash,
    rootFetcher MerkleExpansionRootFetcherFunc,
) ([]common.Hash, error) {

Exploit Scenario
Bob calls `GeneratePrefixProof` with a series of arguments that make the function enter
the `zzz` `!=` `0` branch, expecting the prefix proof returned. However, an error is raised, and
he cannot generate the proof.


Recommendations
Short term, call `MostSignificantBit` with `zzz` instead of `yyy` .


Long term, expand unit tests to achieve greater coverage of the codebase.

6. Divergence in VerifyPrefixProof error handling


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-6


Target: `util/prefix-proofs/prefix_proofs.go`


Description
The `VerifyPrefixProof` implementations diverge. Golang´s `VerifyPrefixProof`
function returns an `ErrIndexOutOfRange` when the function tries to access an index of
the `prefixProof` that is out of bounds; this is done to avoid a panic.

```
 func VerifyPrefixProof(cfg *VerifyPrefixProofConfig) error {
    [...]

     proofIndex := uint64(0)
     for size < cfg.PostSize {
         level, err := MaximumAppendBetween(size, cfg.PostSize)
         if err != nil {
             return err
         }
         if proofIndex >= uint64(len(cfg.PrefixProof)) {
             return ErrIndexOutOfRange
         }
        [...]
        proofIndex++
     }
     [...]
 }
```

_Figure 7.1:_ _`VerifyPrefixProof`_ _function in_ _`prefix_proofs.go#L365-L440`_


However, its Solidity counterpart does not perform this check and, in the instance that an
out-of-bounds index is being accessed, the function will simply revert.

```
 function verifyPrefixProof(
   bytes32 preRoot,
   uint256 preSize,
   bytes32 postRoot,
   uint256 postSize,

```

     exp = appendCompleteSubTree(exp, level, proof[proofIndex]);

     uint256 numLeaves = 1 << level;
     size += numLeaves;
     assert(size <= postSize);
     proofIndex++;
   }

   // Check that the calculated root is equal to the provided post root
   require(root(exp) == postRoot, "Post expansion root not equal post");

   // ensure that we consumed the full proof
   // this is just a safety check to guard against mistakenly supplied args
   require(proofIndex == proof.length, "Incomplete proof usage");
 }
```

Exploit Scenario
While at first glance both functions return an error, it would prove difficult for the
validators to determine what went wrong with the execution of the Solidity code because it
does not return an explicit error, as the Golang implementation does.


Recommendations
Short term, include the index check in the Solidity code and return the corresponding error.


Long term, thoroughly document the divergent behavior and the expected behavior. The
codebase would benefit from the implementation of property testing by first creating a list
of properties each function would need to enforce; using unit tests to validate those
properties; and finally expanding the fuzz tests using those properties as a baseline.

7. Missing validation in Golang’s GeneratePrefixProof function


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-7


Target: `util/prefix-proofs/prefix_proofs.go`


Description
The Golang implementation of the `GeneratePrefixProof` function lacks data validation
for certain cases.


The `GeneratePrefixProof` function allows validators to generate a consistency proof
that some Merkle expansion is a prefix of another. The function will first perform some
checks and then generate the corresponding proof.

```
 func GeneratePrefixProof(

```

```
    prefixHeight uint64,
    prefixExpansion MerkleExpansion,
    leaves []common.Hash,
    rootFetcher MerkleExpansionRootFetcherFunc,
) ([]common.Hash, error) {

```

```
height := prefixHeight
postHeight := height + uint64(len(leaves))
proof, _ := prefixExpansion.Compact()
for height < postHeight {

```

```
 [...]
}

```

```
     return proof, nil
```

_Figure 7.1:_ _`GeneratePrefixProof`_ _function in_ _`[prefix_proofs.go#L296-L351](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/blob/a55f3547f3ef7ebe051b4ed5881f9928a8b4fb73/util/prefix-proofs/prefix_proofs.go#L296-L351)`_


Once a proof is generated, it can be verified through the `VerifyPrefixProof` function.

```
 func VerifyPrefixProof(cfg *VerifyPrefixProofConfig) error {
     if cfg.PreSize == 0 {
         return errors.Wrap(ErrCannotBeZero, "presize was 0")
     }
     root, rootErr := Root(cfg.PreExpansion)
     if rootErr != nil {
         return errors.Wrap(rootErr, "pre expansion root error")

```

     }
     if root != cfg.PreRoot {
         return errors.Wrap(ErrRootMismatch, "pre expansion root mismatch")
     }
     if cfg.PreSize != TreeSize(cfg.PreExpansion) {
         return errors.Wrap(ErrTreeSize, "pre expansion tree size")
     }
     if cfg.PreSize >= cfg.PostSize {
         return errors.Wrapf(
             ErrStartNotLessThanEnd,
             "presize %d >= postsize %d",
             cfg.PreSize,
             cfg.PostSize,
         )
     }
     [...]
 }
```

_Figure 7.2:_ _`VerifyPrefixProof`_ _function in_ _`[prefix_proofs.go#L365-L440](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/blob/a55f3547f3ef7ebe051b4ed5881f9928a8b4fb73/util/prefix-proofs/prefix_proofs.go#L365-L440)`_


The `VerifyPrefixProof` function will perform additional checks on the proof, such as
checking whether the size of the prefix is zero or not. However, these checks could also be
performed by the `GeneratePrefixProof` function to avoid the creation of proofs that are
outright invalid once verified.


Finally, comparing the Golang implementation to the Solidity implementation found in the
test folder shows that the Solidity version does explicitly include these checks, which
indicates a divergence in the implementations of the `GeneratePrefixProof` function.

```
 function generatePrefixProof(uint256 preSize, bytes32[] memory newLeaves)
   internal
   pure
   returns (bytes32[] memory)
 {
   require(preSize > 0, "Pre-size cannot be 0");
   require(newLeaves.length > 0, "No new leaves added");
   [...]
 }
```

Exploit Scenario
The creation of proofs that cannot be verified is allowed. This hides implementation bugs,
as validators running the code will see their proofs being rejected by the
`VerifyPrefixProof` instead of the `GeneratePrefixProof` function.

Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Patching Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-8


Target:
```
 contracts/src/challengeV2/libraries/EdgeChallengeManagerLib.sol

```

Description
Code duplication exists across the `EdgeChallengeManagerLib` contract implementation,
which can result in incomplete fixes and inconsistent behavior (e.g., because the code is
modified in one location but not in all).


The figure below shows an instance of duplicated code that leads to duplicate checks being
performed. However, note that code duplication is present in other areas of the code; we
have documented some of these instances in appendix C.

```
 function hasRival(EdgeStore storage store, bytes32 edgeId) internal view returns
 (bool) {
   require(store.edges[edgeId].exists(), "Edge does not exist");

   // rivals have the same mutual id
   bytes32 mutualId = store.edges[edgeId].mutualId();
   bytes32 firstRival = store.firstRivals[mutualId];
   // Sanity check: it should never be possible to create an edge without having an
 entry in firstRivals
   require(firstRival != 0, "Empty first rival");

   // can only have no rival if the firstRival is the UNRIVALED magic hash
   return hasRivalVal(firstRival);
 }

 function hasLengthOneRival(EdgeStore storage store, bytes32 edgeId) internal view
 returns (bool) {
   require(store.edges[edgeId].exists(), "Edge does not exist");

   // must be length 1 and have rivals - all rivals have the same length
   return (store.edges[edgeId].length() == 1 && hasRival(store, edgeId));

```
          EdgeChallengeManagerLib.sol#L153-L174

```

Exploit Scenario
A new feature is introduced into the protocol that requires the modification of already
existing code. Because the code that requires modification is duplicated across different
places in the codebase, the developer does not update all instances of the code, leading to
the introduction of a bug.


Recommendations
Short term, consider refactoring the code to remove the instances of duplicated code
whenever possible. Note that this will have to be performed on a case-by-case basis
because code duplication may be unavoidable in some instances, as it will depend on how
the library is used by higher-level implementations.


Long term, adopt code practices that discourage code duplication to help prevent this
problem from recurring.

9. Consider implementing “sanity checks” as assertions


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Error Reporting Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-9


Target:
```
 contracts/src/challengeV2/libraries/EdgeChallengeManagerLib.sol

```

Description
The `EdgeChallengeManagerLib` contract contains several instances of code that perform
“sanity checks” using `require` statements. These `require` statements check invariants
[(i.e., conditions that should always be true or false). However, as shown in the Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require)
[documentation, invariants are best checked using assertions.](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require)


Below we can see an example of a “sanity check” that can be found in the code.

```
 function hasRival(EdgeStore storage store, bytes32 edgeId) internal view returns
 (bool) {
   require(store.edges[edgeId].exists(), "Edge does not exist");

   // rivals have the same mutual id
   bytes32 mutualId = store.edges[edgeId].mutualId();
   bytes32 firstRival = store.firstRivals[mutualId];
   // Sanity check: it should never be possible to create an edge without having an
 entry in firstRivals
   require(firstRival != 0, "Empty first rival");

   // can only have no rival if the firstRival is the UNRIVALED magic hash

However, it is not possible to one-step proof an dishonest edge; therefore, there is no need
to wait until the edge has a rival for it to become “one-step provable.” In fact, because
dishonest actors cannot one-step proof edges, they may choose never to create a rival,
thereby removing the ability for the honest actor to use one-step proofs altogether.


Exploit Scenario
Because dishonest actors know they cannot one-step proof a dishonest edge, they choose
to never create a rival, requiring the honest actor to always wait to confirm length-one
edges by time. Note that this can happen regardless at higher-length edges (i.e., by
dishonest actors choosing not to bisect), but in the current implementation, bisecting to
create a length-one edge would be meaningless without a length-one rival.


Recommendations
Short term, consider allowing length-one SmallStep-type edges to be confirmed when they
have no rivals.

11. Incorrect state transition in edgeAtOneStepProof


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-11


Target: `validator/edge_tracker.go`


Description
In the current implementation of the state machine, an edge that is successfully one-step
proven should change its state to confirmed ( `EdgeConfirming` state in this case).
However, in the current implementation, the `act` function will trigger an
`edgeAwaitSubchallangeResolution` event. This will change the state to
`EdgeAwaitingSubchallenge` —a state that is impossible to confirm in the current
implementation and from which it is impossible to exit.

```
 // Edge is at a one-step-proof in a small-step challenge.
 case edgeAtOneStepProof:
     if err := et.submitOneStepProof(ctx); err != nil {
         return errors.Wrap(err, "could not submit one step proof")
     }
     return et.fsm.Do(edgeAwaitSubchallengeResolution{})
 [...]
```

Note that this issue stems from the fact that this code is in the early stages of development.


Recommendations
Short term, trigger the correct event so that the state machine transitions to the
`edgeConfirming` state.


Long term, thoroughly document the expected state transitions that should happen and
the conditions under which they should be triggered.

12. Lack of a terminal state


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-12


Target: `validator/edge_tracker_transition_table.go`


Description
The state machine lacks a terminal state (i.e., an state that marks a “successful flow” or an
state that is “the output” of the state machine). Intuitively, this terminal state should be the
one in which an edge is confirmed. However, the closest state in the current iteration is
`edgeConfirming` which, by virtue of its name, and given that state transitions from itself
to itself (i.e., loops) exist, this state seems more of a “transitory state” before confirmation
of an edge. This reinforces the idea that there should exist another state (e.g.,
`edgeConfirmed` ) that is the actual terminal state of the machine and that indicates that an
edge has been successfully confirmed.

```
 // Finishing.
 {
     Typ: edgeConfirm{},
     From: []edgeTrackerState{edgeAtOneStepProof, edgeConfirming},
     To: edgeConfirming,
 },
```

_Figure 12.1:_ _`newEdgeTrackerFsm`_ _function in_
```
       validator/edge_tracker_transition_table.go#L75-L80

```

Note that there are multiple ways to confirm edges (e.g., by time, by claim, by proof), so

multiple state transitions could end up in a confirmed state).


Recommendations
Short term, consider the inclusion of a terminal state `edgeConfirmed` that represents the
“output” of the state machine.


Long term, thoroughly document the expected state transitions that should happen and
the conditions under which they should be triggered.

13. Possibly unnecessary state transition

Description
When an edge in the `edgePresumptive` state has a rival, its state is changed to
`edgeStarted` .

hasRival, err := et.edge.HasRival(ctx)
if err != nil {

```

```
    return errors.Wrap(err, "could not check if presumptive")

However, this seems unnecessary and possibly incomplete. If the edge has a rival, it could
be bisected; if the edge is of length one and SmallType, it could be one-step proven.
Additionally, other state transitions could be implemented; for example, if the edge is of
length one, is not of SmallType, and has a rival, then it could transition to the
`edgeAtOneStepFork` state.


Note that an edge that has a rival should not remain in the presumptive state, so, for
correctness, it may be necessary to transition the edge state to a different state, even if the
bisection fails.


Finally, the conditions to be checked should be based on what conditions the previous
state checks. For example, since length-one SmallType edges can be one-step proven, it
may not make sense to check for those conditions in the `edgePresumptive` state if the


Trail of Bits 44 Arbitrum Chains Challenge Protocol v2 Assessment

**PUBLIC**


`edgeStarted` state transitions edges under those conditions to the `edgeAtOneStepProof`
state.


Recommendations
Short term, whenever the edge has a rival and/or is of length one or whenever it can be
one-step provable, consider transitioning the state of the edge from `edgePresumptive` to
`edgeBisecting`, `edgeAtOneStepFork`, or `edgeAtOneStepProof` .


Long term, thoroughly document the expected state transitions that should happen and
the conditions under which they should be triggered.

Description
The tracker transition table defines the possible state transitions; however, some of them
never happen in the implementation of the edge tracker in the `act` function.


The following state transitions are defined in the transition table but never happen:


  - from `edgeAtOneStepFork` to `edgeStarted`

  - from `edgeBisecting` to `edgePresumptive`

  - from `edgeAtOneStepProof` to `edgeAtOneStepProof`

  - from `edgeAtOneStepFork` to `edgeAwaitingSubchallenge`


It is unclear if they should not be possible and should be removed from the transition table
or if they are not implemented yet.


Recommendations
Short term, remove the state transitions from the transition table or implement them.


Long term, thoroughly document the expected state transitions that should happen and
the conditions under which they should be triggered.

15. Consider failing early to minimize the impact of griefing attacks


Severity: **Undetermined** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-15


Target: `EdgeChallengerManager.sol`, `EdgeChallengeManagerLib.sol`


Description
Dishonest actors may look to grief honest ones by front-running them and forcing them to
spend gas on failing transactions. Additionally, depending on whether or not gas is
refunded for completing honest actions, dishonest actors may be heavily incentivized to do
so.


Certain actions performed by the challenge contracts are computationally heavy and
require multiple checks to be passed before they can be successfully triggered. However, in
certain instances these checks are done at the very end of the function logic, which means
that the sender may have already spent a substantial amount of gas before arriving at that
check—something that a dishonest actor can capitalize on.


An example of such a function is `createLayerZeroEdge` . As shown in the figures below,
this function requires multiple checks, proof verifications, calls to external contracts,
reading from and writing to storage, etc.:

```
 function createLayerZeroEdge(CreateEdgeArgs calldata args, bytes calldata
 prefixProof, bytes calldata proof)
   external
   payable
   returns (bytes32)
 {
   AssertionReferenceData memory ard;
   if (args.edgeType == EdgeType.Block) {
     bytes32 predecessorId = assertionChain.getPredecessorId(args.claimId);
     ard = AssertionReferenceData(
        args.claimId,
        predecessorId,
        assertionChain.isPending(args.claimId),
        assertionChain.hasSibling(args.claimId),
        assertionChain.getStateHash(predecessorId),
        assertionChain.getStateHash(args.claimId)

}

```

```
          EdgeChallengeManagerLib.sol#L360-L377

```

However, after all of these computationally heavy actions have been performed and the
checks passed, a very important check remains: whether the edge that is being created
already exists. A dishonest actor could front-run honest actors and force them to waste gas
that will not be refunded.

```
 function add(EdgeStore storage store, ChallengeEdge memory edge) internal returns
 (EdgeAddedData memory) {
   bytes32 eId = edge.idMem();
   // add the edge if it doesnt exist already
   require(!store.edges[eId].exists(), "Edge already exists");

Note that it is not possible to accurately measure the impact of this issue at the current
state of development, as we do not have information regarding gas refunds for honest
actions or how the competition between honest actors works (as not only dishonest actors
may choose to front-run).


Recommendations
Short term, whenever possible, consider failing early to reduce the impact of griefing
attacks.


Long term, thoroughly document the assumptions regarding incentives for honest actors
and how gas refunds may work (if they exist). Using that as a baseline, consider
implementing additional safeguards to reduce the impact of griefing attacks like the ones
described in this issue.

16. Presumptive edge tracker never reaches confirmation


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-16


Target: `validator/edge_tracker.go`


Description
An edge tracker in the presumptive state for which a rival is never created will be
indefinitely stuck in the same state and the validator will be unable to advance the
challenge.


As shown in the figure below, whenever an edge reaches the presumptive state the
validator will query the challenge contract to check if any rivals have been created. If any
rivals exist, then the edge state will be changed to the `edgeStarted` state and the
challenge will continue its expected course.

```
 // Edge is presumptive, should do nothing until it loses ps status.
 case edgePresumptive:
     hasRival, err := et.edge.HasRival(ctx)
     if err != nil {

```

```
[...]

```

```
    return errors.Wrap(err, "could not check if presumptive")
}
if hasRival {
    return et.fsm.Do(edgeBackToStart{})
}
return et.fsm.Do(edgeMarkPresumptive{})

```

However, if no rival is ever created, the edge will never leave the presumptive state and the
validator will remain be stuck unable to advance the challenge.


Note that this behavior does not allow the dishonest party to win, as no rival has been
created for the edge; however, it will make the validator unable to progress the challenge.


Trail of Bits 50 Arbitrum Chains Challenge Protocol v2 Assessment

Exploit Scenario
An edge reaches the presumptive state, but a rival is never created. As a result, the
validator will remain stuck in the challenge, unable to confirm it.


Recommendations
Short term, as part of its logic the edge tracker should check whether an edge in the
presumptive state can be confirmed by time.


Long term, thoroughly document the expected state transitions that should happen and
the conditions under which they should be triggered.

17. Front-running a validator can trigger a denial of service


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-17


Target: `validator/edge_tracker.go`


Description
A lack of proper validation of on-chain data allows, in certain instances, dishonest actors to
trigger a denial of service of the validator.


The validator code is responsible for advancing the challenge; this is done through a finite
state machine that represents the possible states a given edge can be in during a challenge,
and that mirrors the state of the challenge contract. Each state will use different heuristics
to determine the next on-chain and off-chain action to trigger; for example, an edge with
no rivals will be moved to the presumptive state in which it will await a rival or check
whether it can be confirmed.


However, in certain instances, the validator fails to accurately determine what the on-chain
state is and, because of that, will fail to trigger the right action or state transition. This
causes the validator code to become stuck on the same state or to jump endlessly between
states.


The figures below show an example of the aforementioned behavior: whenever a validator
tries to bisect an edge that has already been bisected on-chain (something that can be
achieved by simply front-running a validator’s bisection transaction), the validator will be
unable to determine that the bisection has already occurred and will be stuck jumping
between the `edgeBisecting` and `edgeStarted` states, wasting gas and being unable to
advance the challenge.

```
 // Edge should bisect.
 case edgeBisecting:
     lowerChild, upperChild, err := et.bisect(ctx)
     if err != nil {
         if errors.Is(err, solimpl.ErrAlreadyExists) {
             return et.fsm.Do(edgeBackToStart{})
         }
         log.WithError(err).WithFields(fields).Error("Could not bisect")

```

```

```
    return et.fsm.Do(edgeBackToStart{})
}

```

As shown in the figure above, if the bisection fails, the edge tracker will trigger an
`edgeBackToStart` event that will move the state of the edge back to the `edgeStarted`
state. Additionally, as shown below, the `edgeStarted` state will also fail to determine that
the edge was already bisected and will move the edge back to the `edgeBisecting` state
again.

```
 // Start state.
 case edgeStarted:
     canOsp, err := canOneStepProve(et.edge)
     if err != nil {
         return errors.Wrap(err, "could not check if edge can be one step
 proven")
     }
     if canOsp {

```

```
[...]

```

```
    return et.fsm.Do(edgeHandleOneStepProof{})
}
hasRival, err := et.edge.HasRival(ctx)
if err != nil {
    return errors.Wrap(err, "could not check presumptive")
}
if !hasRival {
    return et.fsm.Do(edgeMarkPresumptive{})
}
atOneStepFork, err := et.edge.HasLengthOneRival(ctx)
if err != nil {
    return errors.Wrap(err, "could not check if edge is at one step fork")
}
if atOneStepFork {
    return et.fsm.Do(edgeHandleOneStepFork{})
}
return et.fsm.Do(edgeBisect{})

```

Ultimately, this means that the validator will be spending gas indefinitely and will be unable
to advance the challenge. In extreme cases, this could allow the dishonest actor to win the
challenge.


Trail of Bits 53 Arbitrum Chains Challenge Protocol v2 Assessment

**PUBLIC**


Note that the `edgeBisecting` state is not the only state in which this “looping” behavior
can be seen. Another is the `edgeAtOneStepProof` state, which, in the case that the edge
has already been confirmed, will remain stuck, unable to finish the challenge.

```
 // Edge is at a one-step-proof in a small-step challenge.
 case edgeAtOneStepProof:

```

```
[...]

```

```
if err := et.submitOneStepProof(ctx); err != nil {
    return errors.Wrap(err, "could not submit one step proof")
}
return et.fsm.Do(edgeConfirm{})

Exploit Scenario
A new challenge starts in which Alice and Eve (an honest and dishonest actor, respectively)
are competing.


The challenge proceeds as normal and they are able to go deep into the sub-challenges. At
some point, Alice is meant to trigger a bisection; however, Eve, knowing that she can trigger
a denial of service on Alice’s validator node, front-runs her bisection by copying Alice’s
calldata. This triggers the bisection but leaves Alice’s node stuck spending gas and unable
to compete with Eve, who is able to bisect again and create a presumptive edge.


If Alice is unable to fix her node in time then Eve will be able to win the challenge.


Recommendations
Short term, identify cases of the aforementioned behavior in the different states and
include additional checks in them to help identify instances in which an action cannot be
triggered because it has already been triggered on-chain. This may include bisections that
have already happened on-chain and confirmations that have already happened.


Once the behavior has been identified, trigger the correct actions to follow. For example, if
an edge has already been confirmed, change its state to confirmed. If an edge has already
been bisected, then create new trackers for its children.


Long term, thoroughly document the expected state transitions that should happen and
the conditions under which they should be triggered; additionally, document how to
identify whether a behavior has already been triggered on-chain (for example, by
evaluating the revert reason of the transaction).

`findAncestorsInChallenge` also adds the timer of the searched edge to the returned
`blockChalTimer`, so the timer is added twice.


Exploit Scenario
The validator incorrectly tracks the cumulative unrivaled time of the honest path, causing it
to “think” that it can confirm the edge by time. As a result, the validator will try to call the
challenge contract to start the confirmation process. However, this will fail and result in gas
expenditure.


Recommendations
Short term, remove the addition of the claimed edge timer.


Long term, improve unit testing to verify the expected behavior of the `HonestPathTimer`
function.

20. Top level assertion timer not included in honest path timer calculation


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-20


Target: `validator/challenge-tree/path_timer.go`


Description
Whenever the cumulative unrivaled timer of all honest edges is calculated, the validator
does not account for the unrivaled timer of the honest top-level assertion.


The validator periodically updates the cumulative unrivaled timer of all edges in the honest
path using the `UpdateCumulativePathTimers` function.

```
 func (ht *HonestChallengeTree) UpdateCumulativePathTimers(blockNum uint64) error {

```

```
if ht.honestBlockChalLevelZeroEdge.IsNone() {

```

```
    return nil
}
blockEdge := ht.honestBlockChalLevelZeroEdge.Unwrap()
return ht.recursiveTimersUpdate(

```

```
        0, // Total honest path timer accumulator, starting at 0.
        blockEdge,
        blockNum,
    )
}

```


_Figure 20.1:_ _`UpdateCumulativePathTimers`_ _function in_
```

```

This function recursively navigates the honest path of the tree of edges from the honest
block level-zero edge down to the lowest edge, calculates the cumulative timer, and
updates the edges.

```
 // Recursively updates the path timers of all honest edges tracked in the challenge
 tree.
 func (ht *HonestChallengeTree) recursiveTimersUpdate(
     timerAcc uint64,
     curr protocol.EdgeSnapshot,
     blockNum uint64,

if edgeLength(curr) == 1 {

```
            isRivaled := ht.isRivaled(curr)
            // In case the edge is a small step challenge of length 1, or is

            if curr.GetType() == protocol.SmallStepChallengeEdge ||
!isRivaled {

```

However, as shown in the above snippets, the calculation of the cumulative timer starts at
the level-zero block edge and does not account for unrivaled time of the top-level honest
assertion, which is incorrect.


Exploit Scenario
Because the validator does not account for the unrivaled timer of the top-level honest
assertion when calculating the cumulative unrivaled time of the honest edge path, a
dishonest actor could potentially win the challenge.


Recommendations
Short term, add the unrivaled timer of the honest top-level assertion to the cumulative
unrivaled time calculation.


Long term, improve unit testing to verify the expected behavior of the function.

level assertion


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-21


Target: `validator/challenge-tree/ancestors.go`


Description
When the `HonestPathTimer` function queries the unrivaled time of the honest top-level
assertion, it does so by inputting the ID of an edge and not the ID of the assertion itself.


The `HonestPathTimer` function calculates the cumulative unrivaled time of the honest
edge path. To do so, it navigates the edge tree starting from the honest level-zero block
edge down to the lowest honest edge, calculating the cumulative unrivaled time.


Additionally, it adds the unrivaled time of the top-level honest assertion to the calculation.


```

However, as shown in the snippet above, the `AssertionUnrivaledTime` function is being
called with `queryingFor` as a parameter (i.e., the ID of an edge). This is incorrect; it should
instead take the ID of the honest top-level assertion.


Note that the `AssertionUnrivaledTime` function is currently just an interface and is not
implemented.


Exploit Scenario
When the `HonestParthTimer` function is executed, the call to `AssertionUnrivaledTime`
returns an error because the ID that it expects does not correspond to a top-level
assertion.


Note that this exploit scenario is purely hypothetical, as the function is not currently
implemented.


Recommendations
Short term, input the ID of the honest top-level assertion to the
`AssertionUnrivaledTime` function.

22. The earliestCreatedRivalBlockNumber function can be optimized to
reduce looping


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-22


Target: `validator/challenge-tree/path_timer.go`


Description
The `earliestCreatedRivalBlockNumber` function can be optimized to avoid an
additional loop.


Given an edge, the `earliestCreatedRivalBlockNumber` function returns the creation
block of the earliest created rival or none if it has no rival.


The function calculates the earliest creation block by first iterating over the rivals of the
edge, creating a slice of their creation blocks, and then calling the `util.Min` function over
the slice.

```
 func (ht *HonestChallengeTree) earliestCreatedRivalBlockNumber(e
 protocol.ReadOnlyEdge) util.Option[uint64] {
     rivals := ht.rivalsWithCreationTimes(e)
     creationBlocks := make([]uint64, len(rivals))
     for i, r := range rivals {
         creationBlocks[i] = uint64(r.createdAtBlock)
     }
     return util.Min(creationBlocks)
 }
```

As shown below, The `Min` function will iterate over the slice calculating the minimum.

```
 func Min[T Unsigned](items []T) Option[T] {
     if len(items) == 0 {
         return None[T]()
     }

However, this way of calculating the minimum creation block is not efficient, as it requires
two loops: first looping through the rivals of the edge, creating a slice of their creation
blocks, and then iterating over that slice again to find the minimum. Instead, this
functionality could be achieved by calculating the minimum creation block on the first loop,
thereby avoiding the creation of the slice and its subsequent looping to calculate the
minimum.


Recommendations
Short term, optimize the `earliestCreatedRivalBlockNumber` function by calculating
the minimum creation block when the rivals are being iterated over.


Long term, review the codebase for opportunities to document optimizations and
implement them.

23. The localTimer function can be optimized to reduce computation


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-23


Target: `validator/challenge-tree/path_timer.go`


Description
The `localTimer` function can be optimized for the case in which the edge creation block is
the same as the block for which the query is being made.


Given an edge and a block number, the `localTimer` function returns the unrivaled timer
of the edge at that given block number.


Intuitively, we can identify the following scenarios in this function:


  - If the block number is lower than the creation block of the edge, then the edge was
not yet created and its unrivaled time is therefore zero.

  - If the block number is higher than or equal to the creation block of the edge, then
there are two scenarios:

    - The edge is unrivaled at that block, and its unrivaled time is therefore the
difference between the block number and the edge’s creation block.

    - The edge is rivaled at that block, and its unrivaled time is therefore the
difference between the creation block of the earliest rival and the edge’s
creation block, or zero in the case that the earliest created rival was created
before or at the same time the edge was.


As shown below, these scenarios are being effectively implemented.

```
 func (ht *HonestChallengeTree) localTimer(e protocol.ReadOnlyEdge, blockNum uint64)
 (uint64, error) {
     if blockNum < e.CreatedAtBlock() {
         return 0, nil
     }
     // If no rival at a block num, then the local timer is defined
     // as t - t_creation(e).
     unrivaled, err := ht.unrivaledAtBlockNum(e, blockNum)
     if err != nil {

```

Trail of Bits 65 Arbitrum Chains Challenge Protocol v2 Assessment

**PUBLIC**


```
         return 0, err
     }
     if unrivaled {
         return blockNum - e.CreatedAtBlock(), nil
     }
     // Else we return the earliest created rival's block number: t_rival  t_creation(e).
     // This unwrap is safe because the edge has rivals at this point due to the
 check above.
     earliest := ht.earliestCreatedRivalBlockNumber(e)
     tRival := earliest.Unwrap()
     if e.CreatedAtBlock() >= tRival {
         return 0, nil
     }
     return tRival - e.CreatedAtBlock(), nil
 }
```

_Figure 23.1:_ _`localTimer`_ _function in_
```
       validator/challenger-tree/path_timer.go#L12-L33

```

However, by carefully reviewing the second scenario for the case in which the edge was
created at the block we are querying for, we can make an assumption that would allow us
to optimize the code: that the unrivaled time of an edge at the time of its creation is always
zero, regardless of whether it is rivaled.


Recommendations
Short term, change the first `if` statement from `blockNum` `<` `e.CreatedAtBlock()` to
`blockNum` `<=` `e.CreatedAtBlock()` .


Long term, review the codebase for opportunities to document optimizations and
implement them.

24. Remove honest nodes from the mutual ids map


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-24


Target: `validator/challenge-tree/tree.go`


Description
Whenever a new honest edge is added to the tree, it will also be added to the mutual ID’s
map that is meant to contain all the rivals of that honest edge.


The main purpose of the `AddEdge` function is to track honest edges by adding them to the
honest challenge tree; additionally, the function also tracks rivals by adding them to the
`mutualIds` mapping, which is useful for calculating unrivaled timers.


However, as shown in the snippet below, the function will add honest edges to the
`mutualIds` mapping, which is meant to track only the rivals of the honest edges.

```
 func (ht *HonestChallengeTree) AddEdge(ctx context.Context, eg
 protocol.ReadOnlyEdge) error {
     [...]

```

```
    // Check if the edge id should be added to the rivaled edges set.
    // Here we only care about edges here that are either honest or those whose
start

```

```
// history commitments we agree with.
if agreement.AgreesWithStartCommit || agreement.IsHonestEdge {

```

```
mutualId := eg.MutualId()
mutuals := ht.mutualIds.Get(mutualId)
if mutuals == nil {

```

```
            ht.mutualIds.Put(mutualId, threadsafe.NewMap[protocol.EdgeId,

            mutuals = ht.mutualIds.Get(mutualId)
        }
        mutuals.Put(eg.Id(), creationTime(eg.CreatedAtBlock()))

This behavior is not only redundant (as honest edges are already being tracked), but it also
creates weird semantics in the code, as this behavior implies that an honest edge is a rival
to itself and therefore forces other functions to explicitly remove the honest edge from the
list of rivals when making calculations. One example is in the `rivalsWithCreationTimes`
function, shown below.

```
 func (ht *HonestChallengeTree) rivalsWithCreationTimes(eg protocol.ReadOnlyEdge)
 []*rival {
     rivals := make([]*rival, 0)
     mutualId := eg.MutualId()
     mutuals := ht.mutualIds.Get(mutualId)
     if mutuals == nil {
         ht.mutualIds.Put(mutualId, threadsafe.NewMap[protocol.EdgeId,

Description
The block number is represented as BigInt. In two instances, the `Uint64` part of the block
number is taken without validating that the number can be represented with a `Uint64` .
This could lead to an undefined result.


The first case is in the `Watch` function, which continuously polls the latest block to check for
possible edge-related events.

```
 latestBlock, err := w.backend.HeaderByNumber(ctx, nil)
 if err != nil {
     log.Error(err)
     continue

 toBlock := latestBlock.Number.Uint64()

The second case is in the `getStartEndBlockNum` function, which is used to obtain the
start and end block numbers for the initial query of events in the `Watch` function based on
the latest assertion confirmed.

```
 header, err := w.backend.HeaderByNumber(ctx, nil)
 if err != nil {
     return filterRange{}, err
 }
 return filterRange{

there are any confirmed edges. However, as shown in the snippet below, it does not check
for edges confirmed by time.

Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-28


Target: `validator/edge_tracker.go`, `EdgeChallengeManagerLib.sol`


Description
A discrepancy between the validator code and the contract code when determining
whether an edge can be confirmed by time leads the validator to “believe” that the
confirmation can happen earlier than it should.


The smart contract implementation of confirmation by time allows confirmations only
when the cumulative timer of the edge is higher than the confirmation threshold.

```

   bytes32[] memory ancestorEdgeIds,
   uint256 claimedAssertionUnrivaledBlocks,

   require(
     totalTimeUnrivaled > confirmationThresholdBlock,

```

In contrast, the challenge protocol specification allows confirmations as soon as the
cumulative time of the edge is higher than or equal to the confirmation threshold. While


Trail of Bits 74 Arbitrum Chains Challenge Protocol v2 Assessment

**PUBLIC**


this “off-by-one” discrepancy is not a critical issue, it is nonetheless important that these
checks are consistent across all components of the system.


However, as shown in the snippet below, this is not the case: the validator code follows the
protocol specification, which will lead to a failed confirmation and therefore to unnecessary
gas expenditure.

```
 func (et *edgeTracker) tryToConfirm(ctx context.Context) (bool, error) {
     [...]

     chalPeriod, err := manager.ChallengePeriodBlocks(ctx)

Exploit Scenario
A new challenge is started in which Alice (the honest actor) and Bob participate.


The challenge progresses normally until one of Alice’s edges reaches an unrivaled timer of
`N` (equal to the challenge threshold). The validator code, per the specification, deems the
edge “confirmable” and therefore tries to confirm the edge by sending a transaction to the
challenge contract.


However, because of the “off-by-one” discrepancy, this confirmation fails, and the validator
has to wait one block (i.e., until `N` + 1) to be able to confirm the edge.


Recommendations
Short term, update the Solidity code to follow the protocol specification.


Long term, thoroughly review the timer assumptions between the on and off-chain
components and ensure they are consistent.

29. Front-running certain validator operations leads to honest edges not

Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-29


Target: `validator/edge_tracker.go`


Description
Front-running the validator when a bisection or a new sub-challenge operation is being
performed prevents the newly created honest edge(s) from being tracked.


The validator is responsible for keeping track of all honest edges in a given challenge. Once
an honest edge is created, the validator spawns an edge tracker that, through a finite state
machine, will handle the lifecycle of the edge from its creation to its confirmation.


However, in some instances, the validator may be front-run either by other honest actors
or by dishonest actors, which will cause the validator to miss the creation of the tracker for
those honest edges.


As shown in the snippet below, when a bisection occurs, if the challenge contract returns
an “already exists” error, the tracker state will be changed to the `edgeStarted` state and
the trackers for the children of the edge will not be created.

```

In summary, this will cause the validator to miss the tracker for the honest edges and, in
the worst case scenario, can lead to the dishonest actor winning the challenge if the
behavior goes unnoticed.


Exploit Scenario
A new challenge is started in which Alice (the honest actor) and Bob participate.


The challenge progresses normally until one of Alice’s edges reaches a bisection. The edge
tracker for Alice’s edge sends a transaction to the challenge contract to execute the
bisection, but Bob front-runs Alice’s transaction by copying her calldata, leading to a
successful bisection.


However, because the validator was front-run, the transaction fails and the edge tracker
does not spawn new trackers for the newly created children. This causes the validator to
become stuck and unable to progress the challenge.


Recommendations
Short term, update the validator code so that the tracker behaves differently based on the
error returned by the Solidity implementation. For example, if an “Already exists” error is
returned during a bisection, this means that the bisection already occurred on-chain and
the validator should therefore spawn new trackers for the children.


Long term, thoroughly review the validator code, assuming that the risk of front-running
exists, and document any instances in which front-running could lead to unexpected
behavior.

30. Consider adding an EdgeAwaitingConfirmation state to avoid unnecessary
computation


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-30


Target: `validator/edge_tracker.go`


Description
In certain instances, an edge cannot perform any operation and can only wait for its
confirmation; however, the edge tracker will still perform certain checks or even try to
perform certain actions that are guaranteed to fail.


As shown in the snippet below, whenever an edge is in the `edgeStarted` state, multiple
checks will be performed on it. These include a check to determine whether the edge can
be one step proven, another check to determine whether the edge was already confirmed,
and a check to determine whether the edge has a rival.

```
 case edgeStarted:
     canOsp, err := canOneStepProve(et.edge)
     if err != nil {
         log.WithFields(fields).WithError(err).Error("could not check if edge
 can be one step proven")

```

```
    return et.fsm.Do(edgeBackToStart{})
}
if canOsp {

```

```
    return et.fsm.Do(edgeHandleOneStepProof{})
}
wasConfirmed, err := et.tryToConfirm(ctx)
if err != nil {

```

```
        log.WithFields(fields).WithError(err).Debug("could not confirm edge
yet")

```

```
       return et.fsm.Do(edgeBackToStart{})
   }
   if wasConfirmed {
       return et.fsm.Do(edgeConfirm{})
   }
   hasRival, err := et.edge.HasRival(ctx)
   if err != nil {
       return errors.Wrap(err, "could not check presumptive")
   }

```

     if !hasRival {
         return et.fsm.Do(edgeBackToStart{})

     if err != nil {
         log.WithFields(fields).WithError(err).Error("could not check if edge
 has length one rival")
         return et.fsm.Do(edgeBackToStart{})
     }
     if atOneStepFork {
         return et.fsm.Do(edgeHandleOneStepFork{})
     }
     return et.fsm.Do(edgeBisect{})

```

Ultimately, if all these checks do not pass and the edge has a rival, the tracker will try to
bisect the edge.

```
 case edgeBisecting:

```

```
lowerChild, upperChild, err := et.bisect(ctx)
if err != nil {

```

```
if errors.Is(err, solimpl.ErrAlreadyExists) {

```

```
        return et.fsm.Do(edgeBackToStart{})
    }
    log.WithError(err).WithFields(fields).Error("Could not bisect")
    return et.fsm.Do(edgeBackToStart{})
}

```

```

However, as shown in the snippet above, this bisection can happen only once in the
lifecycle of an edge. Once it has happened, the edge will return to the `edgeStarted` state
and start over, performing the same checks over and over and trying to bisect the edge
again, leading to unnecessary computation.


Exploit Scenario
A new challenge is started in which Alice (the honest actor) and Bob participate.


The challenge progresses normally until one of Alice’s edges reaches a bisection. The edge
tracker for Alice’s edge sends a transaction to the challenge contract to execute the
bisection. The bisection is successful, and the new trackers for the children are spawned.


Trail of Bits 80 Arbitrum Chains Challenge Protocol v2 Assessment

**PUBLIC**


However, the tracker for the bisected edge will continue looping between the
`edgeStarted` and `edgeBisecting` states, performing unnecessary checks and attempting
bisection until it can be confirmed.


Recommendations
Short term, to avoid the unnecessary computation, we propose the inclusion of a new
state, `edgeAwaitingConfirmation` . This state should be used for edges on which no
other operation can be performed and are waiting for confirmation.


The edges that could go into this new state include:


  - Edges that have been bisected

  - Edges that led to a sub-challenge (i.e., length-one `Block` and `BigStep` edges).


Long term, thoroughly review the edge tracker logic for instances of unnecessary
computation and look for opportunities to minimize it.

31. Unclear code comment regarding the ability to disable and enable staking


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-31


Target: `contracts/src/challengeV2/EdgeChallengeManager.sol`


Description
The `EdgeChallengeManager` contract contains a code comment that suggests the staking
mechanism can be disabled; however, in the current implementation, there are no
functions exposing this functionality, as the staking is set upon initialization. Furthermore,
we identified some instances in which disabling or enabling the staking functionality once a
challenge has already started can lead to unexpected behavior.


```
  function createLayerZeroEdge(CreateEdgeArgs calldata args) external returns
(bytes32) {

```

```
...
if (args.edgeType == EdgeType.Block) {

```

```
       ...
       IERC20 edgeStakeToken = stakeToken;
       uint256 edgeStakeAmount = stakeAmount;
// when a zero layer block edge is created it must include a stake. Each time a zero
layer block
// edge is created it forces the honest participants to do some work, so we want to
discentivise
// their creation. The amount should also be enough to pay for the gas costs
incurred by the honest
// participant. This can be arranged out of bound by the excess stake receiver.
// the assertion chain can disable challenge staking by setting a zero stake token
or amount

```

```
       if (address(edgeStakeToken) != address(0) && stakeAmount != 0) {
// since only one edge in a group of rivals can ever be confirmed, we know that we
// will never need to refund more than one edge. Therefore we can immediately send
// all stakes provided after the first one to an excess stake receiver.

```

```
          address receiver = edgeAdded.hasRival ? excessStakeReceiver :
address(this);

```

```
     edgeStakeToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, receiver, stakeAmount);
  }
} else {

```

```
       edgeAdded = store.createLayerZeroEdge(args, ard, oneStepProofEntry,
expectedEndHeight);

```

     }

```

_Figure 31.1: Snippet of the_ _`createLayerZeroEdge`_ _function in_
```
    contracts/src/challengeV2/EdgeChallengeManager.sol#L334-L387

```

This enabling and disabling of staking could lead to unexpected behavior; for example, if
the `stakeAmount` is set to 0 when a layer zero edge is already created with a stake, then
the creator cannot get the stake back, even if it is the winning edge.


Another case is if a layer-zero edge is created when there are no stake requirements and
then activated; the creator can get a refund even if he did not deposit any stake.

```
  function refundStake(bytes32 edgeId) public {
     ChallengeEdge storage edge = store.get(edgeId);
     // setting refunded also do checks that the edge cannot be refunded twice
     edge.setRefunded();

     IERC20 st = stakeToken;
     uint256 sa = stakeAmount;
     // no need to refund with the token or amount where zero'd out
     if (address(st) != address(0) && sa != 0) {
        st.safeTransfer(edge.staker, sa);
     }

     emit EdgeRefunded(edgeId, store.edges[edgeId].mutualId(), address(st), sa);
   }
```

While discussing this issue, the client mentioned that the comment was left over from a
previous design. In the current design, it would not be possible to update the staking for a
given challenge; instead, each challenge would have a challenge manager contract assigned
to it, and each contract would determine whether or not the staking is enabled. We
recommend removing the comment and updating the documentation regarding this aspect
of the system.

32. Validate the withdrawn amount by a staker is greater than zero


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-32


Target: `contracts/src/rollup/RollupUserLogic.sol`


Description
The `withdrawStakerFunds` function allows the stakers to withdraw their deposited
amount of `stakeToken` ; however, it does not validate that the amount to withdraw is
greater than 0. This could allow users to spend gas unnecessarily if they attempt to
withdraw zero tokens. Additionally, this change would be consistent with the use of Ether
as a `stakeToken` in this codebase, where this check is already in place.

```
 function withdrawStakerFunds() external override whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
    uint256 amount = withdrawFunds(msg.sender);
    // This is safe because it occurs after all checks and effects
    require(IERC20Upgradeable(stakeToken).transfer(msg.sender, amount),
 "TRANSFER_FAILED");
    return amount;

Exploit Scenario
A new contract that integrates with the rollup system is created. The developer integrates
the new contract with both the ERC20 and Ether versions of the `RollupUserLogic`
contract. However, the developer is unaware that the behavior of these two differs, and
expects the withdrawals to revert when there are no funds to withdraw. This is not the case
when the target contract is the ERC20 version.


Recommendations
Short term, add a check that the `amount` is greater than zero.


Long term, whenever multiple asset types can be used in a system, it is important that,
whenever possible, the behavior of the system for each asset is the same and that any
difference is thoroughly documented.

33. Consider deleting the staker when their stake is reduced to zero


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-34


Target: `contracts/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol`


Description
The `RollupCore` contract exposes two functions related to the withdrawal of staked funds:
`reduceStakeTo` and `withdrawStaker` . For the most part, these two functions are
essentially the same; the first one allows the sender to indicate the amount of funds to be
left staked, and the second allows stakers to withdraw all available funds.

```
 function reduceStakeTo(address stakerAddress, uint256 target) internal returns
 (uint256) {
   Staker storage staker = _stakerMap[stakerAddress];
   uint256 current = staker.amountStaked;
   require(target <= current, "TOO_LITTLE_STAKE");
   uint256 amountWithdrawn = current - target;
   staker.amountStaked = target;
   increaseWithdrawableFunds(stakerAddress, amountWithdrawn);
   emit UserStakeUpdated(stakerAddress, current, target);
   return amountWithdrawn;
 }
```

_Figure 33.1:_ _`reduceStakeTo`_ _function in_
```
        contracts/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol#L228-L237

```

However, there is another very important difference between the two functions:
`withdrawStaker` deletes the staker entry after withdrawing the funds, but
`reduceStakeTo` does not.

```
 function withdrawStaker(address stakerAddress) internal {
   Staker storage staker = _stakerMap[stakerAddress];
   uint256 initialStaked = staker.amountStaked;
   increaseWithdrawableFunds(stakerAddress, initialStaked);
   deleteStaker(stakerAddress);
   emit UserStakeUpdated(stakerAddress, initialStaked, 0);
 }

```

**PUBLIC**


_Figure 33.2:_ _`withdrawStaker`_ _function in_
```
        contracts/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol#L244-L250

```

This difference is mostly inconsequential; however, `reduceStakeTo` allows the sender to
set the final staked amount to zero, which is essentially the same as withdrawing all the
funds. This suggests that `reduceStakeTo` should also delete the staker entry if the target
is zero.


Exploit Scenario
If the protocol runs under the assumption that stakers without any staked funds should
have their entries removed, then stakers may bypass this “invariant” by calling
`reduceStakeTo` with zero as a target.


Recommendations
Short term, consider whether `reduceStakeTo` should also delete the staker entry
whenever the target is zero.


Long term, whenever two very similar functions are implemented, consider whether they
have any common case and whether or not their behavior in that common case should be
different.

34. Initial assertion’s status is not confirmed


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-ARBCH-34


Target: `contracts/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol`


Description
When initializing the Rollup, an initial empty assertion is created; however, its status will
remain as pending instead of confirmed.


The `initialize` function creates an assertion with an empty state by calling
`AssertionNodeLib.createAssertion` . It then calls `initializeCore` with the created
assertion, which will be set as the `_latestConfirmed` assertion.

`_latestConfirmed`, there is an inconsistency because its state was never set to
`Confirmed` .

 - The `prevAssertionId` method from the `ReadOnlyEdge` interface has a misleading
name as it represents “The id of the assertion of the current challenge”; however, its
name suggests it represents “The id of the parent of the assertion of the current
challenge.”


 - Confirmation checks should precede one-step proof checks. Edges that can be
one-step proven are uncommon (i.e., length-one SmallStep-type edges) so this will
be an “uncommon execution path,” and the check could therefore be made later in
the function to avoid the extra computation.

 - The `nextInboxPosition` variable in name (in `Assertion.sol` ) is not clear as,
intuitively, one might think it refers to “the position of the inbox from which the next
assertion will start reading from”; however, the variable actually represents “the
number of inbox messages the next assertion will process” in the same fashion as
`afterInboxPosition` ; perhaps a better name would be
`nextAfterInboxPosition` .


 - There is duplicated validation of `configHash` . The validation in the `if` branch is
unnecessary, since it is exactly the same as the one done in precedence.

```
    RollupLib.validateConfigHash(prevConfig, prevAssertion.configHash);

     // Check that deadline has passed

## D. Incident Response Recommendations

This section provides recommendations on formulating an incident response plan.


**●** **Identify the parties (either specific people or roles) responsible for**
**implementing the mitigations when an issue occurs (e.g., deploying smart**
**contracts, pausing contracts, upgrading the front end, etc.).**


**●** **Document internal processes for addressing situations in which a deployed**
**remedy does not work or introduces a new bug.**


**○** Consider documenting a plan of action for handling failed remediations.


**●** **Clearly describe the intended contract deployment process.**


**●** **Outline the circumstances under which Offchain Labs will compensate users**
**affected by an issue (if any).**


**○** Issues that warrant compensation could include an individual or aggregate
loss or a loss resulting from user error, a contract flaw, or a third-party
contract flaw.


**●** **Document how the team plans to stay up to date on new issues that could**
**affect the system; awareness of such issues will inform future development**
**work and help the team secure the deployment toolchain and the external**
**on-chain and off-chain services that the system relies on.**


**○** Identify sources of vulnerability news for each language and component used
in the system, and subscribe to updates from each source. Consider creating
a private Discord channel in which a bot will post the latest vulnerability
news; this will provide the team with a way to track all updates in one place.
Lastly, consider assigning certain team members to track news about
vulnerabilities in specific system components.


**●** **Determine when the team will seek assistance from external parties (e.g.,**
**auditors, affected users, other protocol developers) and how it will onboard**
**them.**


**○** Effective remediation of certain issues may require collaboration with
external parties.

**●** **Define contract behavior that would be considered abnormal by off-chain**
**monitoring solutions.**


It is a best practice to perform periodic dry runs of scenarios outlined in the incident
response plan to find omissions and opportunities for improvement and to develop
“muscle memory.” Additionally, document the frequency with which the team should
perform dry runs of various scenarios, and perform dry runs of more likely scenarios more
regularly. Create a template to be filled out with descriptions of any necessary
improvements after each dry run.

#### Detailed Fix Review Results

**TOB-ARBCH-1:** Go Root function does not check for an empty Merkle expansion
[Resolved in PR #179. The Go](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/179) `Root` function now has the same behavior as Solidity's
counterpart by checking if the Merkle expansion is empty.


**TOB-ARBCH-2:** Go Root function does not accept Merkle expansion of MAX_LEVEL
length
[Resolved in PR #194. The Go](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/194) `Root` function now has the same behavior of Solidity's
counterpart by accepting a Merkle expansion of `MAX_LEVEL` length.


**TOB-ARBCH-3:** NewHistoryCommitment does not validate height
[Resolved in PR #342. The](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/342) `height` parameter of the `NewHistoryCommitment` function has
been removed and the `height` is directly inferred from the `leaves` ’ length.


**TOB-ARBCH-4:** Unused errors
[Resolved in PR #202. The unused errors were removed.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/202)


**TOB-ARBCH-5:** GeneratePrefixProof will not work in some cases
[Resolved in PR #213. The](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/213) `zzz` variable is used in `MostSignificantBit` instead of `yyy` .


**TOB-ARBCH-6:** Divergence in VerifyPrefixProof error handling
[Resolved in PR #214. Solidity’s](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/214) `verifyPrefixProof` function was updated to return an
error if the `proofIndex` is out of range.


**TOB-ARBCH-7:** Missing validation in Golang’s GeneratePrefixProof function
[Resolved in PR #223 and PR #342. Additional checks were added to the](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/223)
`GeneratePrefixProof` function. Now it returns an error if the `prefixHeight` is equal to
0, if the `leaves` are empty and if the `prefixHeight` is greater or equal to `postHeight` .


**TOB-ARBCH-8:** Substantial amount of code duplication
[Resolved in PR #225. The code duplication in the](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/225) `hasLengthOneRival` function was
removed.


**TOB-ARBCH-9:** Consider implementing “sanity checks” as assertions
Unresolved. The client provided the following context:


_Won’t fix, as we prefer to keep using revert._


**TOB-ARBCH-10:** Allow one-step proofs for length one SmallStep-type unrivaled
edges
[Resolved in PR #224. The](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/224) `confirmEdgeByOneStepProof` function can now be called for a
SmallStep edge of length 1, even if unrivaled.

**TOB-ARBCH-11:** Incorrect state transition in edgeAtOneStepProof
[Resolved in PR #260. The state transition in case of an](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/260) `edgeAtOneStepProof` has been
corrected to go in the `EdgeConfirmed` state.


**TOB-ARBCH-12:** Lack of a terminal state
[Resolved in PR #260. An](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/260) `EdgeConfirmed` state has been added that represents a terminal
state.


**TOB-ARBCH-13:** Possibly unnecessary state transition
[Resolved in PR #294. The presumptive state was removed.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/294)


**TOB-ARBCH-14:** Possible state transitions never happen
[Resolved in PR #294. The state transitions were removed from the transition table.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/294)


**TOB-ARBCH-15:** Consider failing early to minimize the impact of griefing attacks
Unresolved. The client provided the following context:


_Fixing would require a big overhaul of the entire function logic and we think we are doing_
_the best we can here within reasonable bounds._


**TOB-ARBCH-16:** Presumptive edge tracker never reaches confirmation
[Resolved in PR #294. The presumptive state was removed.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/294)


**TOB-ARBCH-17:** Front-running a validator can trigger a denial of service
[Resolved in PR #303 and PR #313. Before executing the on-chain action, it checks whether](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/303)
the bisection has already happened by checking the existence of the upper child.


**TOB-ARBCH-18:** *LevelZeroEdge snapshots are not updated
[Resolved in PR #279. Snapshots are no longer used; instead, real edges are tracked that will](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/279)
query the chain for data that can change.


**TOB-ARBCH-19:** Claimed edge’s timer of a BigStep edge is counted twice
[Resolved in PR #280 (commit 57f67e2). The addition of the](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/280) `claimedEdgeTimer` has been
removed.


**TOB-ARBCH-20:** Top level assertion timer not included in honest path timer
calculation
[Resolved in PR #327. The](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/327) `HonestPathTimer` function now queries the smart contract for
the assertion and then uses its creation block to calculate its unrivaled time (see
`AssertionUnrivaledBlocks` ).

**TOB-ARBCH-21:** Incorrect input parameter used to get the unrivaled time of the
honest top level assertion
[Resolved in PR #327. The right parameter (the assertion ID) is now being used to call the](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/327)
`AssertionUnrivaledBlocks` function, which previously was named
`AssertionUnrivaledTime` .


**TOB-ARBCH-22:** The earliestCreatedRivalBlockNumber function can be optimized
to reduce looping
[Resolved in PR #342. It now uses only one loop to compute the earliest created rival block](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/342)
number.


**TOB-ARBCH-23:** The localTimer function can be optimized to reduce computation
[Resolved in PR #316. The if statement has been changed to](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/316) `blockNum` `<=`
`e.CreatedAtBlock()` .


**TOB-ARBCH-24:** Remove honest nodes from the mutual ids map
Unresolved. The client provided the following context:


_Removing this ended up breaking quite a lot of our tests in a way that was difficult to_
_debug, and would rather keep the behavior as is given its usage is well-constrained in a_
_package._


**TOB-ARBCH-25:** Unsafe Uint64 operation for block number
[Resolved in PR #329. The validation that requires the number to be an Uint64 has been](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/329)
added.


**TOB-ARBCH-26:** Watcher could miss edges validated by time
[Resolved in PR #293 (commit f9cdf8d). The](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/293) `Watch` function now checks for edges confirmed
by time before entering the polling loop.


**TOB-ARBCH-27:** Possible nil deref when getting a top level assertion
[Resolved in PR #293 (commit f9cdf8d). The top-level assertion is checked to not be None.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/293)


**TOB-ARBCH-28:** Discrepancy between on and off-chain confirmation timers
[Resolved in PR #302. The Solidity implementation of confirmation now allows](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/302)
confirmations when the cumulative timer of the edge is higher than or equal to the
confirmation threshold (the same behavior as the Go counterpart).


**TOB-ARBCH-29:** Front-running certain validator operations leads to honest edges
not being tracked
[Resolved in PR #303. The code now performs some pre-checks before executing on-chain](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/303)
transactions to ensure these have not already happened.

**TOB-ARBCH-30:** Consider adding an EdgeAwaitingConfirmation state to avoid
unnecessary computation
[Resolved in commit b1c5b. A new state](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/commit/b1c5b83476fa62b16e0a73dff9a9223a482d17c6) `EdgeAwaitingConfirmation` was introduced for
edges that have already performed the relevant operations and are awaiting confirmation
(e.g., already bisected edges).


**TOB-ARBCH-31:** Unclear code comment regarding the ability to disable and enable
staking
[Resolved in PR #315. Code comments were updated to reflect the latest implementation.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/315)


**TOB-ARBCH-32:** Validate the withdrawn amount by a staker is greater than zero
[Resolved in PR #321. The withdrawing function for the ERC20 rollup now requires the](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/321)
amount to be greater than zero.


**TOB-ARBCH-33:** Consider deleting the staker when their stake is reduced to zero
Unresolved. The client mentioned that they will fix this finding.


**TOB-ARBCH-34:** Initial assertion’s status is not confirmed
[Resolved in PR #344. The initial assertion’s status is set to be confirmed.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/challenge-protocol-v2/pull/344)
