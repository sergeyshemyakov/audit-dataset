#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Project Targets

The engagement involved a review and testing of the following target.


L1-L3 Teleporter

Repository https://github.com/OffchainLabs/l1-l3-teleport-contracts


Version `6a764526843965ace519c6e066fc8d90e9d43fbe`


Type Smart contract

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

[Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the L1-L3 Teleporter contracts.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/l1-l3-teleport-contracts/commit/6a764526843965ace519c6e066fc8d90e9d43fbe)
The L1-L3 Teleporter provides a way to perform ERC20 transfers from Ethereum mainnet to
Orbit chains via Arbitrum Nitro.


A team of two consultants conducted the review from February 12 to February 16, 2024, for
a total of two engineer-weeks of effort. With full access to source code and documentation,
we performed static and dynamic testing of the contracts, using automated and manual
processes.

#### Observations and Impact

Despite the underlying complexity of the inbox, token bridge, and ArbOS support for
retryable transactions, the L1-L3 teleporter contracts enabled the interactions necessary to
perform L1-L3 token transfers without exposing users to much additional risk. Specifically,
the L1-L3 teleporter design segregates each transfer into a unique contract for each
sender-receiver pair and supports pausing transfers, limiting the amount of funds that
could be lost should a vulnerability be found. We focused on issues that could allow the
theft of funds, cause funds to be trapped in the smart contracts, or result in charging
incorrect fees.


Our review did not uncover any severe vulnerabilities or design flaws. In this report, we
provide a few suggestions that will increase that quality of the code and make it more
maintainable for future versions of the protocol.

#### Recommendations

We recommend performing additional integration testing and manual testing on a
developer/test network prior to deployment.

## Detailed Findings

1. The _setupRole function is deprecated


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Patching Finding ID: TOB-ARBTEL-1


Target: `contracts/L1Teleporter.sol`


Description
The `L1Teleporter` contract inherits the Openzeppelin’s `AccessControl` contract. In the
`constructor` function, the contract uses the `_setupRole` function to give the
`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to the `_admin` address and `PAUSER_ROLE` to the `_pauser` address
(figure 1.1). However, the `_setupRole` function is deprecated in favor of the `_grantRole`
function (figure 1.2).

```
 constructor(address _l2ForwarderFactory, address _l2ForwarderImplementation, address
 _admin, address _pauser)
    L2ForwarderPredictor(_l2ForwarderFactory, _l2ForwarderImplementation)
 {
    _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _admin);
    _setupRole(PAUSER_ROLE, _pauser);
 }
```

_Figure 1.1: The_ _`constructor`_ _function (_ _`[L1Teleporter.sol#L24-L29](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/l1-l3-teleport-contracts/blob/6a764526843965ace519c6e066fc8d90e9d43fbe/contracts/L1Teleporter.sol#L24-L29)`_ _)_

```
 * NOTE: This function is deprecated in favor of {_grantRole}.
 */
 function _setupRole(bytes32 role, address account) internal virtual {
   _grantRole(role, account);
 }
```

Recommendations
Short term, use the `_grantRole` function instead of the `_setupRole` function.


Long term, when using third-party libraries, make sure to accurately review the
documentation and follow recommendations when using the libraries.

2. Vacuous unit tests


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Testing Finding ID: TOB-ARBTEL-2


Target: `test/Teleporter.t.sol`


Description
The tests for the fee logic of the `L1Teleporter` contract are tautological and assert that
the calculation of the function being tested is equivalent to the same calculation. While this
may increase code coverage, it does not specify what is correct, but rather defines the
implementation as correct. Concrete values should be used instead of reperforming the
calculation.

```
  assertEq(
     standardEth,
     standardCosts.l1l2TokenBridgeCost + standardCosts.l2ForwarderFactoryCost
        + standardCosts.l2l3TokenBridgeCost,
     "standardEth"
   );

   // we only check RetryableGasCosts once because it'll be the same for all modes
   assertEq(
     standardCosts.l1l2FeeTokenBridgeCost,
     gasParams.l1l2FeeTokenBridgeGasLimit * gasParams.l2GasPriceBid
        + gasParams.l1l2FeeTokenBridgeMaxSubmissionCost,
     "l1l2FeeTokenBridgeCost"
   );
   assertEq(
     standardCosts.l1l2TokenBridgeCost,
     gasParams.l1l2TokenBridgeGasLimit * gasParams.l2GasPriceBid +
 gasParams.l1l2TokenBridgeMaxSubmissionCost,
     "l1l2TokenBridgeCost"
   );
   assertEq(
     standardCosts.l2ForwarderFactoryCost,
     gasParams.l2ForwarderFactoryGasLimit * gasParams.l2GasPriceBid
        + gasParams.l2ForwarderFactoryMaxSubmissionCost,
     "l2ForwarderFactoryCost"
   );
   assertEq(
     standardCosts.l2l3TokenBridgeCost,
     gasParams.l2l3TokenBridgeGasLimit * gasParams.l3GasPriceBid +
 gasParams.l2l3TokenBridgeMaxSubmissionCost,
     "l2l3TokenBridgeCost"
   );

Recommendations
Short term, add unit tests that explicitly specify expected values, and perform integration
testing against a devnet deployment of Arbitrum Nitro.


Long term, create and implement testing plans as part of the design and development of
new features.

3. Suggested refactorings to make precedence explicit and simplify code


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-ARBTEL-3


Target: `contracts/L1Teleporter.sol,contracts/L2Forwarder.sol`


Description
In the `L1Teleporter` and `L2Forwarder` contracts, some calculations chain arithmetic
operations and rely on the implicit precedence of the operators instead of making the
desired precedence syntactically explicit with parentheses (figures 3.1 and 3.2). In addition,
some calculations are redundant, and the values can be reused to clarify that the values
are expected to be equivalent (figures 3.2 and 3.3). Below are alternative implementations
that are more explicit.

5. Teleport function should document that contract callers should be able to
create retryable tickets


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Configuration Finding ID: TOB-ARBTEL-5


Target: `contracts/interfaces/IL1Teleporter.sol`


Description
The `L1Teleporter` ’s documentation of its teleport function does not mention that callers
of `teleport` may need to create retryable tickets to call `rescueFunds` on the
`L2Forwarder` should “teleporting” to L3 fail. If a contract is immutable and does not have
the capability to create retryable tickets, the sender’s funds may be irrecoverable.

```
 /// @notice Start an L1 -> L3 transfer. msg.value sent must equal the total ETH cost
 of all retryables.
 /// Call `determineTypeAndFees` to calculate the total cost of retryables in
 ETH and the L3's fee token.
 /// If called by an EOA or a contract's constructor, the L2Forwarder will be
 owned by the caller's address,
 /// otherwise the L2Forwarder will be owned by the caller's alias.
 /// @dev 2 retryables will be created: one to send tokens and ETH to the
 L2Forwarder, and one to call the L2ForwarderFactory.
 /// If TeleportationType is NonFeeTokenToCustomFeeL3, a third retryable will
 be created to send the L3's fee token to the L2Forwarder.
 /// ETH used to pay for the L2 -> L3 retryable is sent through the
 l2CallValue of the call to the L2ForwarderFactory.

Recommendations
Short term, document that contracts using the teleporter should include functionality to
create retryables in case they need to call `rescueFunds` on the L2.


Long term, review and implement user-facing documentation and SDKs for validations and
recommendations to make integration less error-prone.
