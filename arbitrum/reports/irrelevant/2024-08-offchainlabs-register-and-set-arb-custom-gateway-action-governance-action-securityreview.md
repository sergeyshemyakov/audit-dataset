#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the governance
`RegisterAndSetArbCustomGateway` [governance action implemented in this PR. This](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/308)
governance action performs the migration for the RARI token to use a custom gateway
when bridging tokens from L1 to L2.


A team of three consultants conducted the review on August 30, 2024 for a total of three
engineer-days of effort. With full access to source code and documentation, we performed
manual review of the code.

#### Observations and Impact

The code review uncovered no issues.


We focused our efforts on checking the correct procedure to safely modify the
configuration of the token bridge. We also checked if external users could block or delay
the action, and looked for any exceptional behavior in the (re)execution of retryable tickets
needed to complete this configuration change.


We did not review any of the RARI codebase nor its on-chain configuration. This audit
focused on the correct interaction between the governance action and the token bridge.

#### Recommendations

Despite the lack of identified issues, Offchain Labs should be careful when executing this
governance action, since the RARI contract configuration could suddenly change or become
misconfigured before triggering the action.
