#### ‭Test Coverage Disclaimer‬

‭All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in‬
‭accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.‬


‭Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be‬
‭provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in‬
‭this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or‬
‭defects in the target system or codebase.‬


‭Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security‬
‭properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but‬
‭each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that‬
‭violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use‬
‭is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.‬

**‭PUBLIC‬** ‭Security Assessment‬


## ‭Executive Summary‬

#### ‭Engagement Overview‬

‭Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of fixes for a number of‬
‭high-severity issues found after Stylus was deployed.‬


‭A team of two consultants conducted the review from September 11 to September 19,‬
‭2024, for a total of two engineer-weeks of effort. With full access to source code and‬
‭documentation, we performed a manual review of the affected code and the fixes.‬

#### ‭Observations and Impact‬

‭During the engagement, we verified that the proposed fixes completely mitigate the‬
‭high-severity issues found after Stylus was deployed, including an activation edge case that‬
‭was found during this engagement (‬‭TOB-STYLUS-FIX-1‬‭);‬‭note that this issue was also found‬
‭by Offchain Labs during a refactor of the affected code.‬


‭Additionally, we reviewed a set of governance actions to upgrade ArbOS to version 32‬
‭(‬ `‭L1ModuleRootArbOneAction‬` ‭,‬ `‭L1ModuleRootNovaAction‬` ‭,‬‭and‬ `‭L2ArbOS32Action‬` ‭) and‬
‭two emergency actions that will be executed if Stylus needs to be disabled‬
‭(‬ `‭SetInkPriceOneAction‬` ‭,‬ `‭SetWasmMaxStackDepthZeroAction‬` ‭).‬


‭The governance actions will upgrade ArbOS to version 32 and set the new module root‬
‭hash on both Nova and ArbOne; additionally, they will revert any changes made by either‬
‭of the emergency actions, effectively re-enabling Stylus if either of the emergency actions‬
‭was executed; otherwise (i.e., if the emergency actions were not executed), they will simply‬
‭upgrade the ArbOS version and the module root.‬


‭All the aforementioned action contracts are correct; additionally, we verified that the‬
‭correct module root hash,‬
`‭0x184884e1eb9fefdc158f6c8ac912bb183bf3cf83f0090317e0bc4ac5860baa39‬` ‭,‬‭is‬
‭being employed in all the actions and confirmed that it is the root hash generated by the‬
‭reviewed Nitro changes.‬

#### ‭Recommendations‬

‭Perform an ArbOS upgrade with the reviewed actions, either as an emergency or‬
‭nonemergency measure, depending on whether the issues are actively exploitable and‬
‭whether it is likely that the issues will be identified by third parties.‬

## ‭Detailed Findings‬

‭1. Importing forward__set_trap produces a failure in WASM instantiation‬


‭Severity:‬ **‭High‬** ‭Difficulty:‬ **‭Low‬**


‭Type: Data Validation‬ ‭Finding ID: TOB-STYLUS-FIX-1‬


‭Target:‬ `‭forward_stub.wat‬`


‭Description‬
‭Users can deploy a specially crafted Stylus program that will cause ArbOS to panic after the‬
‭activation checks are passed.‬


‭Users can access a variety of imports to call in their Stylus programs. These are included in‬
‭the‬ `‭forward_stub.wat‬` ‭file:‬

```
   ‭;; allows user_host to request a trap‬
   ‭(global $trap (mut i32) (i32.const 0))‬
   ‭(func $check unreachable)‬
   ‭(func (export "forward__set_trap") unreachable)‬
   ‭;; user linkage‬
   ‭(func (export "vm_hooks__read_args") (param i32) unreachable)‬
   ‭(func (export "vm_hooks__write_result") (param i32 i32) unreachable)‬
   ‭…‬
```

_‭Figure 1.1: Part of the‬_ _`‭forward_stub.wat‬`_ _‭file‬_


‭The imports available to users from the‬ `‭vm_hooks‬` ‭module‬‭are properly documented and‬
‭seem to work correctly, but there is an additional import available called‬
`‭forward__set_trap‬` ‭. Using this import will produce‬‭a valid Stylus program that will‬
‭correctly pass the activation checks.‬


[‭However, the imports defined for‬‭WASM instantiation‬‭are only the ones from the‬](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/modules.html#exec-instantiation)
`‭vm_hooks‬` ‭module.‬

```
 ‭define_imports!(‬
    ‭"vm_hooks" => host {‬
      ‭read_args, write_result, exit_early,‬
      ‭storage_load_bytes32, storage_cache_bytes32, storage_flush_cache,‬
 ‭transient_load_bytes32, transient_store_bytes32,‬
      ‭call_contract, delegate_call_contract, static_call_contract, create1,‬
 ‭create2, read_return_data, return_data_size,‬
      ‭emit_log,‬

```

_‭Figure 1.2: WASM instantiation in ArbOS using the Wasmer API‬_


‭Trying to activate a Stylus program that imports‬ `‭forward__set_trap‬` ‭will produce a panic‬
‭in the ArbOS code:‬

```
 ‭thread '<unnamed>' panicked at stylus/src/util.rs:19:5:‬
 ‭encountered fatal wasm: init failed‬

 ‭Caused by:‬
   ‭Error while importing "forward"."set_trap": unknown import. Expected‬
 ‭Function(FunctionType { params: [], results: [] })‬

 ‭Location:‬
   ‭stylus/src/native.rs:207:24‬
```

_‭Figure 1.3: Part of the panic error when trying to activate a Stylus program that imports‬_
```
                ‭forward__set_trap‬

```

‭Note that this issue was independently discovered by the Offchain Labs team as well as by‬
‭Trail of Bits, during this review.‬


‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭Eve deploys a specially crafted Stylus program that imports‬ `‭forward__set_trap‬` ‭, meaning‬
‭that it will halt the chain once it is activated.‬


‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, remove the‬ `‭forward__set_trap‬` ‭export from‬ `‭forward_stub.wat‬` ‭.‬


‭Long term, consider creating a complete specification of the allowed WASM properties‬
‭enforced during WASM activation and include additional test cases.‬

## ‭B. Code Quality Recommendations‬

‭The following recommendations are not associated with specific vulnerabilities. However,‬
‭they enhance code readability and may prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities in the‬
‭future.‬

#### ‭General‬


‭●‬ ‭Consider using the‬ `[‭must_use‬](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/hint/fn.must_use.html)` ‭Rust hint‬‭in functions‬‭such as‬

`‭flush_storage_cache‬` ‭to mitigate the possibility that‬‭the caller will ignore the‬
‭return value.‬

#### ‭arbitrator/wasm-libraries/user-host-trait/src/lib.rs‬


‭●‬ ‭Consider expanding the documentation of each function in the file to include the‬

‭minimum and maximum value of ink and gas that needs to be charged for every‬
‭call. Additionally, clearly note whether an internal function handles the‬
‭computational cost of each operation. This will help to prevent computational costs‬
‭from being undercharged or overcharged.‬


‭●‬ ‭Related to the previous recommendation, add unit tests to cover average and‬

‭corner cases in the ink/gas usage for each function.‬

## ‭C. WASM Security Measures for Stylus‬

‭This appendix lists the current security measures and constraints checked during WASM‬
‭activation. These checks guarantee that WASM activation produces Stylus programs that‬
‭are secure and execute correctly.‬

#### ‭Imports‬

‭WASM imports have the following constraints:‬


‭●‬ ‭In general, only the function imports available in the‬ `‭forward_stub.wat‬` ‭file are‬

‭available to use.‬


‭●‬ ‭Only function imports are valid. WASM programs importing other entities such as‬

‭tables or memories will immediately fail validation.‬


‭●‬ ‭The use of imports with valid names but incorrect signatures will immediately fail‬

‭validation.‬


‭●‬ ‭Any use of imports with the reserved prefix‬ `‭stylus_‬` ‭will immediately fail validation.‬


‭However, we must note the following:‬


‭●‬ ‭Imports can be duplicated as long as they are consistent and the number of‬

‭duplicates is not directly limited.‬


‭●‬ ‭Imports can have special characters such as the null character (‬ `‭\00‬` ‭).‬

#### ‭Exports‬

‭In general, users are free to export any function they need. However, there are number of‬
‭constraints:‬


‭●‬ ‭The‬ `‭user_entrypoint‬` ‭export must be available, and‬‭it should have a specific‬

‭signature.‬


‭●‬ ‭Export names cannot shadow any import names, either the raw name (e.g.,‬

`‭pay_for_memory‬` ‭) or the full canonical name (e.g.,‬ `‭module__pay_for_memory‬` ‭).‬


‭●‬ ‭Any use of exports with the reserved prefix‬ `‭stylus_‬` ‭will immediately fail validation.‬


‭●‬ ‭Some special global exports will be added to support ink metering (e.g.,‬

`‭stylus_ink_left‬` ‭). These exports are correctly added‬‭at the end of the global‬
‭index space and cannot be accessed by users directly.‬


‭●‬ ‭Exports can have special characters such as the null character (‬ `‭\00‬` ‭).‬

#### ‭Additional Internal Functions‬

‭A number of internal functions are added into WASM programs during activation. These‬
‭functions should never be used directly by the user. Fortunately, calling them is not‬
‭possible since user WASM programs are validated to make sure the function indices are‬
‭correct, so adding more internal functions is safe as long as they are added at the end of‬
‭the function index space.‬
