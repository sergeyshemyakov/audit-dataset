Offchain Labs’ request. Material within this report may not be reproduced or distributed in

#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the Office Hours governance
[action implemented in this PR. This action provides support for executing a batch of other](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/311)
actions only during certain hours of the day.


A team of three consultants conducted the review on August 29, 2024, for a total of three
engineer-days of effort. With full access to source code and documentation, we performed
manual review of the code.

#### Observations and Impact

The code review uncovered no issues.


We focused our efforts on checking the correct implementation of timezone handling and
other time-related edge cases. We also verified that the possible inputs are meaningful and
looked for potential misuse of the time specification.


We did not review any particular usage of this action, but instead focused on the code that
must be deployed in order to ensure that a batch of actions is executed correctly during
certain hours of the day.

#### Recommendations

Despite the lack of issues, the client should be careful when deploying and using the Office
Hours in the context of governance actions, particularly when using the minimum
timestamp parameter, since an incorrect value can produce an action that cannot be
executed until very far in the future.
