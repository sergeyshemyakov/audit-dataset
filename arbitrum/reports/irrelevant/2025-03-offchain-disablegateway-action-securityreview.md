## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the governance action that disables the USDT
standard gateway for deposits, in preparation for using USDT0. These changes correspond
[to PR #334 (](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/334) `873c0e9` ).


The commit in scope involves setting up a dummy gateway in the token bridge of the
Arbitrum One rollup for USDT. Essentially, this change disables USDT user deposits. The
[deposits should be already handled by the new USDT infrastructure, named USDT0.](https://usdt0.to/)


A team of two consultants conducted the review from February 20 to February 21, 2025, for
a total of two engineer-days of effort. With full access to source code and documentation,
we performed a manual review of the code in scope.

#### Observations and Impact

The code review uncovered no issues.


We focused our efforts on checking the correct procedure to safely modify the
configuration of the token bridge. We also checked if external users could block or delay
the action and looked for any exceptional behavior in the (re)execution of retryable tickets
needed to complete this configuration change.


We did not review any of the USDT codebase nor its on-chain configuration. This audit
focused on the correct interaction between the governance action and the token bridge.

#### Recommendations

We recommend that Offchain Labs make sure the community is aware of this change.
When the gateway is disabled, it will cause an unexpected revert for either users or
third-party integrations.

#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.
