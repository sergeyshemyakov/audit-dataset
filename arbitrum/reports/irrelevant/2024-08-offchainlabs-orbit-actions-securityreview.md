#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of their Orbit governance actions
for various upgrades. The upgrades included in this audit are updating the wasm root hash;
upgrading the rollup contracts to version 0.2.1; increasing the time delay for governance
actions; enabling the fast confirm committee; and migrating any previous AnyTrust fast
confirmer.


A team of one consultant conducted the review from August 12, 2024 to August 16, 2024,
for a total of one engineer-week of effort. Our testing efforts focused on the manual review
of the code that performs the upgrade actions.

#### Observations and Impact

The identified issues relate to the incorrect usage of a Gnosis Safe multisig. In particular,
TOB-ORBUPG-001 allows external users to block an upgrade, requiring redeployment of
the action contract to complete the upgrade.

#### Recommendations

Based on the codebase maturity evaluation and findings identified during the security
review, Trail of Bits recommends that Offchain Labs take the following steps:


  - **Carefully monitor the blockchain during the deployment and execution of**
**upgrade actions.** Although the use of an additional salt value on the deployment
mitigates TOB-ORBUPG-001, front-running the transaction is possible in certain
cases.


  - **Properly document how chain owners should use Gnosis Safe multisig for**
**implementing a fast confirmation committee.** This will avoid future issues during
deployment and usage of this third-party component.

#### Finding Severities and Categories

The following tables provide the number of findings by severity and category.

## Project Goals

The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of the Orbit and Governance
Upgrade Actions v2.1. Specifically, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list of
questions:


  - Is there any way to block or delay the execution of an upgrade?


  - Do the upgrades introduce any security risks?


  - Does a storage change of the upgraded version of the rollup code create any
potential issues?


  - Is the Gnosis Safe multisig correctly configured and used?

## Project Coverage

This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by
our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:


  - [Upgrade Orbit contracts and permissionless enable fast confirmation: These provide](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/orbit-actions/pull/16)
a number of state changes in the rollup:


    - Allow Orbit chains to upgrade to v2.1.0 from supported versions. Only
relevant contracts (i.e., `ChallengeManager`, `OSP`, `RollupLogics` ) are
upgraded.


    - Configure `condOsp` to support ongoing challenges using the old `OSP` .


    - Additionally, the `EnableFastConfirmAction` contract provides an easy
approach to enable fast confirmation by bundling the setup of all
dependencies.


    - Schedule ArbOS 31 Bianca upgrade using the ArbOS upgrade at timestamp
action.


    - Enable WASM cache manager using the `AddWasmCacheManagerAction`
upgrade action.


  - [Upgrade Orbit contracts and permissioned enable fast confirmation using a specific](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/305)
address: This action is similar to the previous one, but instead of deploying a Gnosis
Safe multisig, it enables fast confirmation using a specific address.


  - [Updates governance timelock delay: this action introduces an eight-day delay on the](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/306)
execution of governance action, which allows users to withdraw funds if they do not
agree with the governance action (or even if it is malicious).


  - Migrate `[anyTrustFastConfirmer](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/233)`, if any exists: This action ensures that any
previous AnyTrust fast confirmer is migrated.

#### Coverage Limitations

Because of the time-boxed nature of testing work, it is common to encounter coverage
limitations. The following list outlines the coverage limitations of the engagement and
indicates system elements that may warrant further review:


  - We did not review Gnosis Safe multisig code, except for the specific interactions
during deployment of the upgrade action.


  - We did not review code changes between compatible upgrade versions (e.g. 1.1.0 to
2.1.0), except for their effect on the state compatibility after the upgrade.

## Detailed Findings

1. Gnosis safe deployment allows users to disrupt governance action
execution


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Timing Finding ID: TOB-ORBUPG-001


Target:
```
 contracts/parent-chain/fast-confirm/EnableFastConfirmAction.sol

```

Description
Any user can accidentally or intentionally block the usage of a Gnosis safe deployment to
set up a fast confirmer committee as part of the governance action.


The fast confirmer configuration action deploys a Gnosis Safe multisig in order to
implement a committee of validators to fast-confirm a rollup state:


```
  function perform(IRollupAdmin rollup, address[] calldata fastConfirmCommittee)
external {

```

```
     …
     address fastConfirmer =
IGnosisSafeProxyFactory(GNOSIS_SAFE_PROXY_FACTORY).createProxyWithNonce(

```

```
GNOSIS_SAFE_1_3_0,
abi.encodeWithSignature(

```

```
"setup(address[],uint256,address,bytes,address,address,uint256,address)",
          fastConfirmCommittee,
          fastConfirmCommittee.length,
          address(0),
          "",
          GNOSIS_COMPATIBILITY_FALLBACK_HANDLER,
          address(0),
          0,
          address(0)
       ),
       uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(rollup)))
     );
     rollup.setAnyTrustFastConfirmer(fastConfirmer);
     address[] memory validators = new address[](1);
     validators[0] = fastConfirmer;
     bool[] memory val = new bool[](1);
     val[0] = true;
     rollup.setValidator(validators, val);

```

```
     rollup.setMinimumAssertionPeriod(1);
   }
```

However, since the deployment is performed in a deterministic way using `create2` from a
factory contract, the salt must be unique to avoid collisions. Using the same salt as the one
from an already-deployed Gnosis Safe will cause this action to revert.


The updated version of the code includes a salt value that mitigates this issue:

```
   function perform(IRollupAdmin rollup, address[] calldata fastConfirmCommittee,
 uint256 salt) external {
     …
     address fastConfirmer =
 IGnosisSafeProxyFactory(GNOSIS_SAFE_PROXY_FACTORY).createProxyWithNonce(
        GNOSIS_SAFE_1_3_0,
        abi.encodeWithSignature(

 "setup(address[],uint256,address,bytes,address,address,uint256,address)",
          fastConfirmCommittee,
          fastConfirmCommittee.length,
          address(0),
          "",
          GNOSIS_COMPATIBILITY_FALLBACK_HANDLER,
          address(0),
          0,
          address(0)
        ),
        salt
     );
```

_Figure 1.2:_ _Part of the_ _`perform`_ _function from the fast confirmation action_


However, we stress that this is only a mitigation, as front-running this transaction in certain
chains like Ethereum mainnet is still feasible.


Additionally, in the `UpgradeAndEnableFastConfirmAction` action, the rollup owner
must perform the deployment of the `AnyTrustFast` confirmer:

```
   function perform() external {
     …

     // Setup AnyTrustFastConfirmer
     require(
        IRollupAdminFC(rollupAddress).anyTrustFastConfirmer() == address(0),
        "UpgradeAndEnableFastConfirmAction: Fast confirm already enabled"
     );
     IRollupAdminFC(rollupAddress).setAnyTrustFastConfirmer(
        anyTrustFastConfirmer

```

```
     );
     require(
        IRollupAdminFC(rollupAddress).anyTrustFastConfirmer()
          == anyTrustFastConfirmer,
        "UpgradeAndEnableFastConfirmAction: Unexpected anyTrustFastConfirmer"
     );

     // Set AnyTrustFastConfirmer as validator
     address[] memory validators = new address[](1);
     validators[0] = anyTrustFastConfirmer;
     bool[] memory values = new bool[](1);
     values[0] = true;
     IRollupAdmin(rollupAddress).setValidator(validators, values);
     require(
        IRollupCore(rollupAddress).isValidator(anyTrustFastConfirmer),
        "UpgradeAndEnableFastConfirmAction: Failed to set validator"
     );

     // Set minimum assertion period
     IRollupAdmin(rollupAddress).setMinimumAssertionPeriod(
        newMinimumAssertionPeriod
     );
     require(
        IRollupCore(rollupAddress).minimumAssertionPeriod()
          == newMinimumAssertionPeriod,
        "UpgradeAndEnableFastConfirmAction: Failed to set minimum assertion
 period"
     );
   }
```

_Figure 1.3:_ _Part of the_ _`perform`_ _function from the fast confirmation and upgrade action_


Again, if the deployment uses Gnosis Safe multisig and an attacker is able to guess and
front-run the deployment, the result could be catastrophic for the rollup.


Exploit Scenario
A malicious user front-runs the creation of the Gnosis safe deployment, blocking the
governance action until it is created again.


Recommendations
Short term, carefully monitor the blockchain during the deployment and execution of this
governance action to detect potential front-running attempts.


Long term, review the security assumptions and requirements for third-party code before
using it in governance actions.

2. Threshold of signatures used in fastConfirmer is overly inflexible


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Configuration Finding ID: TOB-ORBUPG-002


Target:
```
 contracts/parent-chain/fast-confirm/EnableFastConfirmAction.sol

```

Description
The fast confirmer committee is implemented using a Gnosis Safe that uses the maximum
threshold, making it very inflexible if changes are needed.

```
 function perform(IRollupAdmin rollup, address[] calldata fastConfirmCommittee,
 uint256 salt) external {
     …
     address fastConfirmer =
 IGnosisSafeProxyFactory(GNOSIS_SAFE_PROXY_FACTORY).createProxyWithNonce(
        GNOSIS_SAFE_1_3_0,
        abi.encodeWithSignature(

 "setup(address[],uint256,address,bytes,address,address,uint256,address)",
          fastConfirmCommittee,
          fastConfirmCommittee.length,
          address(0),
          "",
          GNOSIS_COMPATIBILITY_FALLBACK_HANDLER,
          address(0),
          0,
          address(0)
        ),
        salt
     );
     …
```

_Figure 2.1: Part of the_ _`perform`_ _function from the fast confirmer action_


However, using the maximum threshold while providing maximum protection to the rollup
can be overly inflexible, potentially preventing a required administrative action in the
Gnosis Safe itself.


Exploit Scenario
A member of the fast confirm committee has their key leaked, destroyed, or revoked. The
remaining members of the committee are unable to change the Gnosis Safe multisig
configuration since they do not reach the threshold limit.


Trail of Bits 14 Offchain Labs Orbit Actions Security Assessment

Recommendations
Short term, allow chain owners to select the threshold number. This issue was fixed and
verified during the last part of the review.


Long term, review the security assumptions and requirements for third-party code before
using it in governance actions.
