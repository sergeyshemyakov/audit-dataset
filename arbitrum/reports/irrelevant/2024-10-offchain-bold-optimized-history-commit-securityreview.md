#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the BoLD protocol’s optimized
history commitment feature. History commitments as they are currently implemented in
BoLD would be extremely inefficient, and the most recent implementation uses a number
optimizations that need to be reviewed.


A team of two consultants conducted the review from September 30 to October 4, 2024, for
a total of two engineer-weeks of effort. With full access to source code and documentation,
we performed a manual review and automated testing of the code in scope.

#### Observations and Impact

We found a single medium-severity issue related to the use of floating-point operations in
validators with different hardware architectures.


We focused our efforts on checking the implementation of the optimized history
commitment functions with expected and unexpected inputs. Through these efforts, we
found a number of code quality issues, described in appendix A. Additionally, we
differentially tested the optimized and unoptimized implementations to ensure they return
matching root values; recommendations resulting from this testing are provided in
appendix B.


We did not review any interactions with other BoLD components.

#### Recommendations

[Offchain Labs should use the fast version of log2 provided in PR #691 to fix TOB-OPTHIST-1](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/691)
and should implement all the code quality recommendations to make sure they do not
eventually become issues.

## Detailed Findings

1. Use of floating-point operations can produce different results


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-OPTHIST-1


Target: `history_commitment.go`


Description
[The use of IEEE 754 in the computation of history commitments could produce different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754#:~:text=The%20IEEE%20Standard%20for%20Floating,and%20Electronics%20Engineers%20%0x28IEEE%0x29.)
results if a node triggers implementation-specific behavior.


Several `float64()` variables are used while computing history commitments. The use of
`float64()` [in Go can lead to varying output precision depending on the hardware](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/36536)
[architecture. This occurs because the internal representation and handling of floating-point](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/36536)
numbers can differ across platforms.

```
 func (h *HistoryCommitter) prefixAndProof(index uint64, leaves []common.Hash,
 virtual uint64) (prefix []common.Hash, tail []common.Hash, err error) {
     // Code omitted from excerpt
     logVirtual := int(math.Log2(float64(virtual)) + 1)
```

_Figure 1.1: Part of the_ _`prefixAndProof`_ _function_


The use of `float64()` in Go follows the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic.
However, the processing of floating-point numbers and the rules for rounding and
precision can differ between operating system and hardware implementations. Different
hardware architectures may have varying precision levels and rounding modes, while
different operating systems may use different libraries and compiler settings for
floating-point arithmetic. Consequently, performing calculations using `float64()` on
different operating system and hardware combinations can result in varying output
precision, leading to differences in decimal places or in the least significant digits,
potentially introducing consensus issues and unintended blockchain forks.


Exploit Scenario
In a blockchain network, different nodes are running on diverse operating systems and
hardware architectures, causing slight variations in floating-point precision during the
computation of history commitments to emerge. These discrepancies lead to inconsistent
validation outcomes, resulting in a split within the network and unintended blockchain
forks.

Recommendations
Short term, remove the use of IEEE 754 from the computation of values affecting
[consensus; replace it with the fast version of log2, provided in PR #691.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/pull/691)


Long term, thoroughly test the history commitment code on different operating system
platforms and hardware architectures to identify and address any issues related to
undefined behavior.

## A. Code Quality Recommendations

The following recommendations are not associated with specific vulnerabilities. However,
they enhance code readability and may prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities in the
future.


  - In the `precomputeRepeatedHashes` function, implement the null pointer check
before the pointer is dereferenced.


```
func (h *HistoryCommitter) precomputeRepeatedHashes(leaf *common.Hash, n int)
([]common.Hash, error) {

```

```
    if len(h.lastLeafFillers) > 0 && h.lastLeafFillers[0].Cmp(*leaf) == 0 &&
len(h.lastLeafFillers) >= n {

```

```
    return h.lastLeafFillers, nil
}
if leaf == nil {

```

```
       return nil, errors.New("nil leaf pointer")
   }
```

_Figure A.1: The header of the_ _`precomputeRepeatedHashes`_ _function_


(This recommendation was already implemented during the audit.)


- The optimized and unoptimized implementations return different height field
values. It is unclear whether this can cause issues in other BoLD components.


```
func NewCommitment(leaves []common.Hash, virtual uint64) (*Commitment, error) {

```

```
// Code omitted from excerpt
// TODO: Generate the inclusion proofs necessary.
return &Commitment{

```

```
        Height: virtual,
        Merkle: root,
        FirstLeaf: leaves[0],
        LastLeaf: leaves[len(leaves)-1],
    }, nil
}

```

```
func New(leaves []common.Hash) (History, error) {

```

```
// Code omitted from excerpt

```

```
return History{

```

```
        Merkle: root,
        Height: uint64(len(leaves) - 1),
        FirstLeaf: leaves[0],
        LastLeaf: leaves[len(leaves)-1],
        FirstLeafProof: firstLeafProof,
        LastLeafProof: lastLeafProof,
    }, nil
}

```

_Figure A.2: The return statements using the optimized and unoptimized implementations’ data_

_structures_


 - Remove the redundant `else` statement in the `prefixAndProof` function. The
function already checks whether `m` is nonzero in the `if` statement highlighted in
figure A.3, making the highlighted `else` statement redundant— `m` does not change
between the statements. (This recommendation was already implemented during
the audit.)

```
func (h *HistoryCommitter) prefixAndProof(index uint64, leaves []common.Hash,
virtual uint64) (prefix []common.Hash, tail []common.Hash, err error) {
    m := uint64(len(leaves))
    if m == 0 {
        return nil, nil, errors.New("nil leaves")
    }
    // Code omitted from excerpt

    // Ensure m > 0 before accessing leaves[m-1]
    if m > 0 {
        h.lastLeafFillers, err = h.precomputeRepeatedHashes(&leaves[m-1],
logVirtual)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, nil, err
        }
    } else {
        return nil, nil, errors.New("leaves slice is empty")
    }
```

_Figure A.3: Part of the_ _`prefixAndProof`_ _function_


 - Remove the redundant check in the `prefixAndProof` function. The function
already checks whether the `virtual` variable is nonzero in the first `if` statement
highlighted in figure A.4, making the second highlighted `if` statement
redundant— `virtual` does not change between the statements. (This
recommendation was already implemented during the audit.)

```
func (h *HistoryCommitter) prefixAndProof(index uint64, leaves []common.Hash,
virtual uint64) (prefix []common.Hash, tail []common.Hash, err error) {
    m := uint64(len(leaves))
    if m == 0 {
        return nil, nil, errors.New("nil leaves")
    }
    if virtual == 0 {
        return nil, nil, errors.New("virtual size cannot be zero")
    }
    if m > virtual {
        return nil, nil, fmt.Errorf("num leaves %d should be <= virtual %d", m,
virtual)
    }
    if index+1 > virtual {

```

```
        return nil, nil, fmt.Errorf("index %d + 1 should be <= virtual %d",
index, virtual)
    }

    // Check for potential overflow before doing math.Log2
    if virtual == 0 {
        return nil, nil, errors.New("virtual size cannot be zero")
    }
    logVirtual := int(math.Log2(float64(virtual)) + 1)
```

_Figure A.4: Part of the_ _`prefixAndProof`_ _function_


 - Change the name of the variable `m`, which represents the length of the slice of
leaves, to a more descriptive name, such as `lenLeaves` .

```
func (h *HistoryCommitter) prefixAndProof(index uint64, leaves []common.Hash,
virtual uint64) (prefix []common.Hash, tail []common.Hash, err error) {
    m := uint64(len(leaves))
```

_Figure A.5: Part of the_ _`prefixAndProof`_ _function_


 - Define an explicit return value for the following branch of the `proof` function (e.g.,
`return nil, nil` ).

```
func (h *HistoryCommitter) proof(index uint64, leaves []common.Hash, virtual, limit
uint64) (tail []common.Hash, err error) {
    m := uint64(len(leaves))
    if m == 0 {

```

```
    return nil, errors.New("empty leaves slice")
}
if limit == 0 {

```

```
    limit = nextPowerOf2(virtual)
}
if limit == 1 {

```

```
    // Can only reach this with index == 0
    return
}

```


_Figure A.6: Part of the_ _`proof`_ _function_


 - Define invariants for the `limit` and `virtual` variables and their relationship. The
`limit` variable is always assumed to be a power of two, while `virtual` is _often_
assumed to be higher than the number of leaves and greater than or equal to
`limit` .

```
// computeVirtualSparseTree returns the htr of a hashtree where the first layer
// is passed as leaves, the completed with the last leaf until it reaches
// virtual and finally completed with zero hashes until it reaches limit.
// limit is assumed to be either 0 or a power of 2 which is greater or equal to
// virtual. If limit is zero it behaves as if it were the smallest power of two

```

```
// that is greater or equal than virtual.
```

_Figure A.7: Part of the inline documentation for the_ _`computeVirtualSparseTree`_ _function_


However, some externally callable functions, such as `GeneratePrefixProof`, have
only a `virtual` variable, which makes it unclear what the constraints on the
variable should be.

```
func (h *HistoryCommitter) GeneratePrefixProof(prefixIndex uint64, leaves
[]common.Hash, virtual uint64) ([]common.Hash, []common.Hash, error) {
    rehashedLeaves := make([]common.Hash, len(leaves))
    for i, leaf := range leaves {
        result, err := h.hash(leaf[:])
        if err != nil {
            return nil, nil, err
        }
        rehashedLeaves[i] = result
    }
    prefixExpansion, proof, err := h.prefixAndProof(prefixIndex, rehashedLeaves,
virtual)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, nil, err
    }
    prefixExpansion = trimTrailingZeroHashes(prefixExpansion)
    proof = trimZeroes(proof)
    return prefixExpansion, proof, nil
}
```

_Figure A.8: The_ _`GeneratePrefixProof`_ _function_


Additionally, the `virtual` parameter of the `prefixAndProof` function is never
constrained to be a power of two:

```
func (h *HistoryCommitter) prefixAndProof(index uint64, leaves []common.Hash,
virtual uint64) (prefix []common.Hash, tail []common.Hash, err error) {
    // Code omitted from excerpt
    logVirtual := int(math.Log2(float64(virtual)) + 1)
```

## B. Go Fuzzing Recommendations

The following recommendations are related to the use of fuzz testing on the optimized
BoLD history commitment code.


  - Cover both the happy path and the error paths in the fuzz tests. The current code
favors the happy path but does not check whether the errors are correctly used. For
instance, the example code shown in figure B.1 could be used to verify that only two
types of errors are reachable in practice. When these errors are reached, it must be
caused by some condition and nothing else.

```
 computedRoot, err := NewCommitment(hashedLeaves, virtual)
 if err != nil {
     if err.Error() == "virtual should be >= num leaves" {
         if virtual < numReal {
             return
         }
     }
     if err.Error() == "must commit to at least one leaf" {
         if numReal == 0 {
             return
         }
     }

     panic(err)
 }

 if virtual < numReal {
     panic(fmt.Sprintf("virtual should be >= leaves: numReal: %d, virtual: %d",
 numReal, virtual))
 }
```

_Figure B.1: Suggested code to check for correct error handling in the_ _`NewCommitment`_ _function._
_Note that this code requires a different error string for the first case in the original code in order_

_to work correctly._


  - Perform differential fuzzing of the unoptimized implementation in the relevant
cases, such as the case shown in figure B.2.

```
 if numReal == virtual {
     legacyInputLeaves := make([]common.Hash, virtual)
     for i := range legacyInputLeaves {
         legacyInputLeaves[i] = simpleHash
     }
     histCommit, _ := history.New(legacyInputLeaves)
     if err != nil {
         panic(err)
     }

```

```
    if computedRoot.Merkle != histCommit.Merkle /*|| computedRoot.Height !=
histCommit.Height*/ {
        panic(fmt.Sprintf("%s != %s or %d != %d with numReal: %d, virtual: %d",
computedRoot.Merkle, histCommit.Merkle, computedRoot.Height, histCommit.Height,
numReal, virtual))
    }
}
```

_Figure B.2: Suggested code to perform differential fuzzing between the optimized_
_implementation’s_ _`NewCommitment`_ _function and the unoptimized implementation_


 - Add a call to the `GeneratePrefixProof` function to the fuzz testing to make sure
this function works as expected.


 - Add explicit invariant checks to the `virtual` and `limit` variables given the
documented properties:


    - “ `limit` is assumed to be a power of two that is greater than or equal to the
length of the leaves.”


    - “ `limit` is assumed to be either zero or a power of two that is greater than or
equal to `virtual` .”

```
func (h *HistoryCommitter) computeSparseTree(leaves []common.Hash, limit uint64,
fillers []common.Hash) (common.Hash, error) {
    if !(bits.OnesCount64(limit) == 1 && limit >= uint64(len(leaves))) {
        panic(fmt.Sprintf("Invalid limit: %d when using %d leaves", limit,
len(leaves)))
    }

func (h *HistoryCommitter) computeVirtualSparseTree(leaves []common.Hash, virtual,
limit uint64) (common.Hash, error) {
    if !(limit == 0 || (bits.OnesCount64(limit) == 1 && limit >= virtual)) {
        panic(fmt.Sprintf("Invalid limit: %d when using virtual as %d", limit,
virtual))
    }
```
