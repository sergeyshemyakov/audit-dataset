Trail of Bits​ 2​ Offchain Security Council Rotation Update​
**PUBLIC​** **​** Security Assessment


## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the changes made to the
governance contracts to allow council members to rotate their own keys without a
[proposal. These changes correspond to PR #322 (](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/322) `57f495c` ).


The commits in scope involve changes that resolve previously detected issues in an earlier
version of the implementation, along with a new feature to allow upcoming council
members to set a new key when the cohort is replaced. Only the production smart contract
changes were in scope.


A team of two consultants conducted the review from February 13 to February 19, 2025, for
a total of eight engineer-days of effort. With full access to source code and documentation,
we performed a manual review of the code in scope.

#### Observations and Impact

This engagement revealed an issue related to the removal of an upcoming council member.
Additionally, we provide some recommendations for improving the code quality in the
Code Quality Recommendations appendix.

#### Recommendations

Based on the security review, Trail of Bits recommends that Offchain Labs take the
following steps:


●​ Remediate the finding disclosed in this report as part of a direct remediation or any
refactor that may occur when addressing other recommendations.


●​ Review the items in the Code Quality Recommendations appendix and consider
taking action on each one.

Trail of Bits​ 3​ Offchain Security Council Rotation Update​
**PUBLIC​** **​** Security Assessment


1. Member removal does not offer protection when the cohort has already
been elected


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Timing​ Finding ID: TOB-SC-ROT-1


Target: `SecurityCouncilManager.sol`


Description
The security council member removal code does not correctly handle the case where the
election has already ended and the cohort is queued for changing, allowing malicious
members to temporarily evade removal.


Security council members can perform key rotation using two different options. The first
one allows members to rotate the key directly:

```
  function rotateMember(
 address newMemberAddress,
 address memberElectionGovernor,
 bytes calldata signature
 ) external {
 uint256 lastRotatedTimestamp = lastRotated[msg.sender];
 if (lastRotatedTimestamp != 0 && block.timestamp < lastRotatedTimestamp +
 minRotationPeriod)
 {
 revert RotationTooSoon(msg.sender, lastRotatedTimestamp +
 minRotationPeriod);
 }
 // we enforce that a the new address is an eoa in the same way do
 // in NomineeGovernor.addContender by requiring a signature
 uint256 currentRotationNonce = rotationNonce[msg.sender];
 address newAddress = ECDSAUpgradeable.recover(
 getRotateMemberHash(msg.sender, currentRotationNonce), signature
 );
 // we safety check the new member address is the one that we expect to
 replace here
 // this isn't strictly necessary but it guards agains the case where the
 wrong sig is accidentally used
 if (newAddress != newMemberAddress) {
 revert InvalidNewAddress(newAddress);
 }

```

```

The second option offers the opportunity to execute the rotation indirectly when the
cohort is changed, storing the address to rotate to in the `rotatingTo` mapping. This is
executed some time after the election is resolved, when the cohort is replaced:

```
  function replaceCohort(address[] memory _newCohort, Cohort _cohort)
 external
 onlyRole(COHORT_REPLACER_ROLE)
 {
 if (_newCohort.length != cohortSize) {
 revert InvalidNewCohortLength({cohort: _newCohort, cohortSize:
 cohortSize});
 }

 // delete the old cohort
 _cohort == Cohort.FIRST ? delete firstCohort : delete secondCohort;
 address[] storage otherCohort = _cohort == Cohort.FIRST ? secondCohort :
 firstCohort;

 for (uint256 i = 0; i < _newCohort.length; i++) {
 // we have to change the array so correct _newCohort can be emitted
 address rotatingAddress = rotatingTo[_newCohort[i]];
 if (rotatingAddress != address(0)) {
 // only replace if there is no clash
 if (
 !SecurityCouncilMgmtUtils.isInArray(rotatingAddress, _newCohort)
 && !SecurityCouncilMgmtUtils.isInArray(rotatingAddress,
 otherCohort)
 ) {
 _newCohort[i] = rotatingAddress;
 }
 }
 _addMemberToCohortArray(_newCohort[i], _cohort);
 }

 _scheduleUpdate();
 emit CohortReplaced(_newCohort, _cohort);
 }

```

_Figure 1.2: The_ _`replaceCohort`_ _function_


Address rotation needs to be implemented correctly to avoid allowing a potentially
malicious member to evade removal. The process for removing a security council address
includes some code to specifically prevent this evasion. This includes keeping track of the

​

previously rotated address, in order to correctly remove it when the `removeMember`
function is called:

```
 function removeMember(address _member) external onlyRole(MEMBER_REMOVER_ROLE) {
 if (_member == address(0)) {
 revert ZeroAddress();
 }
 address memberIfRotated = memberRotatedTo(_member);

 Cohort cohort = _removeMemberFromCohortArray(memberIfRotated);
 _scheduleUpdate();
 emit MemberRemoved({member: memberIfRotated, cohort: cohort});
 }

```

_Figure 1.3: The_ _`removeMember`_ _function_


However, when the address is rotated indirectly using `setRotatingTo`, there is no
mapping to track who rotated that key, nor any way to avoid the key removal if a security
member key is compromised.


Exploit Scenario
Alice’s address is approved for the security council election. The voting takes place, and
Alice is elected. The call to `replaceCohort` is scheduled for execution. Eve compromises
Alice’s private key. The current security council or DAO decides to remove Alice from the
security council. They deploy an action to remove Alice’s address, to be executed once the
cohort is changed. Eve calls `setRotatingTo` at the very last minute, before the execution
of `replaceCohort` . The security council / DAO need to take action on the new Eve address.


Recommendations
Short term, document this behavior to make sure the relevant actors (e.g., the security
council or the DAO itself) are aware of the removal process during the process of the
cohort change.


Long term, review the incident response plan and procedures across components to make
sure all the relevant situations are covered and there is adequate infrastructure to perform
them.

## A. Code Quality Recommendations

The following is a list of findings that were not identified as immediate security issues but
may warrant further investigation.


●​ The `rotatingTo` mapping entries are never removed. This can introduce
vulnerabilities with future updates that use the `rotatingTo` mapping.


●​ Be careful when using the `addMember` and `replaceMember` functions, as the
`_addMemberToCohortArray` internal function removes the `rotatedTo` mapping
entry for the newly added member. This can lead to unexpected behavior if a
member is added again after being rotated away.

#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.
