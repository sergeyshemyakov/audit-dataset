#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the ArbOS 30 upgrade. ArbOS
30 is an upgrade of the Arbitrum chains that enables Stylus and other features. ArbOS 30
adds support for the Stylus virtual machine, which executes WebAssembly (WASM) rather
than EVM bytecode and allows developers to write smart contracts in Rust and other
languages that can compile to WASM. During this engagement, we did not review the Stylus
code itself, but instead reviewed the merging changes related to that feature as well as
some additional features and changes in the `go-ethereum` side.


A team of three consultants conducted the review from May 6 to May 17, 2024, for a total
of six engineer-weeks of effort. Our testing efforts focused on issues resulting in consensus
failure for Arbitrum blocks before or after the upgrade. With full access to source code and
documentation, we performed static and dynamic testing of the target using automated
and manual processes.

#### Observations and Impact

During this engagement, we uncovered medium-severity findings affecting some of the
math primitives used by ArbOS (TOB-ARBOS30-003). We also found some informational
issues affecting the `secp256r1` implementation, the CGo call types, and the
`CacheManager` contract.

#### Recommendations

Based on the codebase maturity evaluation and findings identified during the security
review, Trail of Bits recommends that Offchain Labs take the following steps:


  - **Remediate the findings disclosed in this report.** These findings should be
addressed as part of a direct remediation or as part of any refactor that may occur
when addressing other recommendations.


  - **Improve testing of ArbOS math functions** . The lack of strong unit tests and
fuzzing tests on the math-related functions should be addressed to avoid future
related issues.

## Project Goals

The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of the Offchain Labs ArbOS
30 upgrade. Specifically, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list of
questions:


  - Is the ArbOS 30 upgrade safe to perform? Are there any consensus issues after the
upgrade is enabled?


  - Is the ArbOS bookkeeping correct and updated when necessary? Is there any
bookkeeping from its internal state that is not properly committed or reverted?


  - Is the ArbOS 30 upgrade retro-compatible with the expected behavior of previous
versions?

## Project Coverage

This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by
our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:


  - **General review of the ArbOS 30 upgrade:** We manually reviewed the changes
made in the ArbOS 30 upgrade. This upgrade included several small features,
including the new `secp256r1` precompile, more efficient usage of retryable tickets,
and a number of small fixes. For this review, we used the provided patch files and
the individual PRs; we looked for common golang flaws and upgrade issues, such as
incorrect updates to the ArbOS state, issues that enable upgrade features before
the system is actually upgraded, issues that invalidate the blocks created before the
upgrade, issues that enable denial-of-service attacks or theft of funds, and issues
that break the consensus protocol.


  - **Additional changes required to merge Stylus** : ArbOS 30 allows users to run
WASM programs using Stylus. While we did not audit Stylus itself during this review,
we checked that the merge procedure with the current ArbOS 30 code was correct.
In particular, we reviewed how each conflict was solved, and if the modified code
has not introduced additional issues.


  - **Stylus smart contract changes** : ArbOS 30 requires a number of small changes in
the smart contracts, including a conditional OSP for new Stylus fraud proofs and a
number of upgrade actions, including performing the ArbOS30 upgrade itself,
adjusting relevant chain parameters, and modifying the fee recipients of the Nova
chains. We reviewed each upgrade action to assess whether it performs its task
correctly, and whether it can be blocked by external users.


  - **The** **`go-ethereum`** **upgrade:** The `go-ethereum` Offchain fork was recently modified
to implement the changes related to version v1.13.11. The `go-ethereum` upgrade
includes a number of changes, including gas estimation and logging changes. We
verified that these changes will not conflict with Arbitrum’s specific modifications
required for ArbOS to work properly. We also reviewed how the upgrade is enabled
to ensure that it is in sync with the ArbOS 30 upgrade.


For the ArbOS upgrade, Offchain Labs provided a list of files relevant to the state transition
function. This list was then further refined to include only those that actually had any
changes between the given commits (obtained via `git` `diff` `--name-only`
`consensus-v20` `b8a9479f77aa358d53e10e2944257a8483ff64a8` ). Only the changes
between ArbOS20 ( `consensus-v20` ) and ArbOS30
( `b8a9479f77aa358d53e10e2944257a8483ff64a8` ) were reviewed in the following files in
the `nitro` repository:

#### Coverage Limitations

Because of the time-boxed nature of testing work, it is common to encounter coverage
limitations. The following list outlines the coverage limitations of the engagement and
indicates system elements that may warrant further review:


  - We have not reviewed in detail how the ArbOS and `go-ethereum` codebases
evolved. We used the diff files provided by Offchain Labs to bound the scope of this
assessment.


  - We have not performed a cryptographical review of the `secp256r1` standard or the
cryptographic primitives used to implement it.


  - We have not audited the previous versions of the code, only the changes provided.
For instance, in the case of the new release of ArbOS, we audited only the changes
from the `consensus-v20` tag to the ArbOS 30 commit provided by Offchain Labs,
but we did not comprehensively audit any of these versions.

## Detailed Findings

1. secp256r1 precompile does not check for signature malleability


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Undetermined**


Type: Cryptography Finding ID: TOB-ARBOS30-1


Target: `crypto/secp256r1/pubkey.go`


Description
The implementation of the `ecdsa.Verify` function from the `secp256r1` package is
vulnerable to signature malleability attacks. This issue arises from the fact that the function
accepts malleable signatures as valid inputs:

```
 // Verifies the given signature (r, s) for the given hash and public key (x, y).
 func Verify(hash []byte, r, s, x, y *big.Int) bool {
     // Create the public key format
     publicKey := newPublicKey(x, y)

     // Check if they are invalid public key coordinates
     if publicKey == nil {
         return false
     }

     // Verify the signature with the public key,
     // then return true if it's valid, false otherwise
     return ecdsa.Verify(publicKey, hash, r, s)
 }
```

_Figure 1.1:_ _`secp256r1`_ _’s_ _`ecdsa.Verify`_ _function accepts malleable signatures_

_(_ _`[go-ethereum/crypto/secp256r1/verifier.go#8–21](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/blob/0636cc447c08581274f2c6159a38ece22446db42/crypto/secp256r1/verifier.go#L8-L21)`_ _)_


Signature malleability refers to the ability to modify a valid signature without invalidating it,
which can lead to potential security risks. Accepting multiple values for the components of
the signature allows an attacker to create a different valid signature for the same message,
potentially causing issues in systems that rely on unique signatures.


While the standard specifies this as the expected behavior, users need to be very aware of
this, since malleable signatures have produced many security incidents in the past.

```
 Wrapper libraries SHOULD add a malleability check by default, with functions
 wrapping the raw precompile call (exact NIST FIPS 186-5 spec, without malleability

```

```
 check) clearly identified. For example, P256.verifySignature and
 P256.verifySignatureWithoutMalleabilityCheck. Adding the malleability check is
 straightforward and costs minimal gas.
```

_[Figure 1.2: Part of the RIP-7212 standard](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md)_


Recommendations
Short term, properly document this behavior to ensure that users are aware of the
implications of calling this precompile. Consider recommending a wrapper library that
[performs malleability checks (e.g., something similar to the OpenZeppelin code).](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol#L122C1-L139)


Long term, review the usage of Ethereum/Rollup standards across the codebase to identify
potential misuse of them by users.

2. secp256r1 precompile uses a deprecated function


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Undetermined**


Type: Cryptography Finding ID: TOB-ARBOS30-2


Target: `crypto/secp256r1/pubkey.go`


Description
The public key validation depends on the `IsOnCurve` primitive, which was recently
deprecated in golang 1.21.


The current implementation of the `secp256r1` precompile verifies that the values provided
are part of the relevant elliptic curve:

```
 func newPublicKey(x, y *big.Int) *ecdsa.PublicKey {
     // Check if the given coordinates are valid
     if x == nil || y == nil || !elliptic.P256().IsOnCurve(x, y) {
         return nil
     }
     …
 }
```

_Figure 2.1:_ _`Header`_ _of the_ _`newPublicKey`_ _function_


However, the latest version of the `IsOnCurve` function contains a deprecation note:

```
 // IsOnCurve reports whether the given (x,y) lies on the curve.
 //
 // Deprecated: this is a low-level unsafe API. For ECDH, use the crypto/ecdh
 // package. The NewPublicKey methods of NIST curves in crypto/ecdh accept
 // the same encoding as the Unmarshal function, and perform on-curve checks.
 IsOnCurve(x, y *big.Int) bool
```

_Figure 2.2: Deprecated comment on the_ _`IsOnCurve`_ _method_


Recommendations
Short term, document usage of a deprecated method in the precompile code and
documentation.


Long term, review the usage of deprecated API across the codebase.

3. Incorrect implementation of integer math functions


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARBOS30-3


Target: `nitro/util/arbmath/math.go`


Description
Several math functions for integer values are implemented incorrectly and do not handle
overflow cases.


The `AbsValue` function allows overflow to occur for minimum integer values and does not
panic.

```
 func AbsValue[T Ordered](value T) T {
     if value < 0 {
         return -value // never happens for unsigned types
     }
     return value
 }
```

_Figure 3.1: The_ _`AbsValue`_ _function implementation for generic_ _`Ordered`_ _types_

_(_ _`[nitro/util/arbmath/math.go#77–83](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/7a440202198e724b60b79a51735c7cafb6b6901c/util/arbmath/math.go#L77-L83)`_ _)_


The `SaturatingAdd` function returns incorrect values when reaching saturation. The
positive case returns `-1` instead of the expected maximum integer value. This is because
the right-shift operator `>>` implements a signed arithmetic shift for integer types.


In a similar manner, the negative case returns `0` instead of the minimum integer value.

```
 // SaturatingAdd add two integers without overflow
 func SaturatingAdd[T Signed](a, b T) T {
     sum := a + b
     if b > 0 && sum < a {
         sum = ^T(0) >> 1
     }
     if b < 0 && sum > a {
         sum = (^T(0) >> 1) + 1
     }
     return sum
 }

The `SaturatingSub` function does not handle overflow in the subtrahend when it equals
the minimum negative integer value. It further compounds the errors from the
`SaturatingAdd` function.

```
 // SaturatingSub subtract an int64 from another without overflow
 func SaturatingSub(minuend, subtrahend int64) int64 {
     return SaturatingAdd(minuend, -subtrahend)
 }
```

The `SaturatingMul` function, similarly to the `SaturatingAdd` function, returns `-1` for the
positive saturating case and `0` for the negative case.

```
 // SaturatingMul multiply two integers without over/underflow
 func SaturatingMul[T Signed](a, b T) T {
     product := a * b
     if b != 0 && product/b != a {
         if (a > 0 && b > 0) || (a < 0 && b < 0) {
             product = ^T(0) >> 1
         } else {
             product = (^T(0) >> 1) + 1
         }
     }
     return product

The `SaturatingNeg` function incorrectly checks for the case when the provided value
equals `-1` ( `^T(0)` ) instead of the minimum integer value. It further incorrectly returns -1
instead of the maximum value in the special case.

```
 // Negates an int without underflow
 func SaturatingNeg[T Signed](value T) T {
     if value == ^T(0) {
         return (^T(0)) >> 1
     }
     return -value
 }

The highlighted math functions are used in a few places throughout the codebase. For
example, the `SaturatingAdd` function is used in `internal_tx.go` .

The `SaturatingMul` and `SaturatingSub` function are both used in `batch_poster.go` .

```

We further found that the `SaturatingMul` function is used in other parts of the `arbmath`
package, such as the `NaturalToBips` and the `PercentToBips` functions.

```
 func NaturalToBips(natural int64) Bips {
     return Bips(SaturatingMul(natural, int64(OneInBips)))

Recommendations
Short term, consider reverting the changes that allow for generic type implementations of
the `arbmath` functions. Additionally, include unit tests that cover important edge cases.


Alternatively (although we do not recommend the usage of the `unsafe` package),
implement the correct integer math functions using helper functions `MaxSignedValue`
and `MinSignedValue` .

```
 // MaxSignedValue returns the maximum value for a signed integer type T
 func MaxSignedValue[T Signed]() T {
     return T(1<<(8*unsafe.Sizeof(T(0))-1) - 1)
 }

 // MinSignedValue returns the minimum value for a signed integer type T
 func MinSignedValue[T Signed]() T {
     return T(1 << (8*unsafe.Sizeof(T(0)) - 1))
 }

```

Trail of Bits 23 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

_Figure 3.13: The_ _`MaxSignedValue`_ _and_ _`MinSignedValue`_ _helper functions_


Return the maximum integer value in the case of a positive, and the minimum integer value
in the case of a negative integer overflow, for the `SaturatingAdd` and `SaturatingMul`
functions.

```
 // SaturatingAdd adds two integers without overflow
 func SaturatingAdd[T Signed](a, b T) T {
     sum := a + b
     if b > 0 && sum < a {
         return MaxSignedValue[T]()
     }
     if b < 0 && sum > a {
         return MinSignedValue[T]()
     }
     return sum
 }
```

_Figure 3.14: The corrected_ _`SaturatingAdd`_ _function_

```
 // SaturatingMul multiply two integers without over/underflow
 func SaturatingMul[T Signed](a, b T) T {
     product := a * b
     if b != 0 && product/b != a {

```

```
if (a > 0 && b > 0) || (a < 0 && b < 0) {

```

```
    product = MaxSignedValue[T]()
} else {

```

```
            product = MinSignedValue[T]()
        }
    }
    return product
}

```


_Figure 3.15: The corrected_ _`SaturatingMul`_ _function_


The `SaturatingSub` function should be rewritten to properly handle the case when `b`
equals the minimum integer value, as negating the value and reusing `SaturatingAdd`
would result in an overflow.

```
 // SaturatingSub subtracts two integers without overflow
 func SaturatingSub[T Signed](a, b T) T {
     diff := a - b
     if b < 0 && diff < a {
         return MaxSignedValue[T]()
     }
     if b > 0 && diff > a {
         return MinSignedValue[T]()
     }
     return diff
 }

```

_Figure 3.16: The corrected_ _`SaturatingSub`_ _function_


For the `SaturatingNeg` function, correct the value in the comparison by checking for the
minimum integer value, and return the maximum integer value.


```
// SaturatingNeg negates an integer without underflow
func SaturatingNeg[T Signed](value T) T {

```

```
if value == MinSignedValue[T]() {

```

```
        return MaxSignedValue[T]()
    }
    return -value
}

```


_Figure 3.17: The corrected_ _`SaturatingNeg`_ _function_


For the `AbsValue` function, consider panicking in the case of an overflow, or returning an
error.

```
 // AbsValue returns the absolute value of a number
 func AbsValue[T Number](value T) T {

```

```
if value < 0 {

```

```
if value == MinSignedValue[T]() {

```

```
            panic("AbsValue: overflow detected for minimum signed value")
        }
        return -value
    }
    return value
}

```


_Figure 3.18: An_ _`AbsValue`_ _function which panics in the overflow case_


Alternatively, consider implementing a `SaturatingAbsValue` function that clips the
output to the maximum integer value.

```
 // SaturatingAbsValue returns the absolute value of a number
 func SaturatingAbsValue[T Number](value T) T {

```

```
if value < 0 {

```

```
if value == MinSignedValue[T]() {

```

```
            return MaxSignedValue[T]()
        }
        return -value
    }
    return value
}

```


_Figure 3.19: An implementation of_ _`SaturatingAbsValue`_ _that saturates in the overflow case_

consider fuzz testing, as this will help ensure more robust testing coverage.

Description
Go’s CGo FFI calls contain differing and incorrect parameter type definitions compared to
the corresponding function definitions in Rust.


For certain `hostio` FFI calls, such as `readInboxMessage` and
`readDelayedInboxMessage`, Go encodes the offset parameter as a `uint32`, whereas
Rust’s type definition specifies `usize` for these.

As the `wavmio` functions are required when the compilation target is WebAssembly, in this
case the `usize` types will resolve to `uint32` .


Furthermore, Go's `resolveTypedPreimage` function’s parameter, which defines the
pre-image type `ty`, is declared as `uint32` .

```
 //go:wasmimport wavmio resolveTypedPreimage
 func resolveTypedPreimage( ty uint32, hash unsafe.Pointer, offset uint32, output

The corresponding function declaration on Rust’s side expects a `u8` value.

```
 pub unsafe extern "C" fn wavmio__resolveTypedPreimage(
   preimage_type: u8,
   hash_ptr: GuestPtr,
   offset: usize,

Recommendations
Short term, be explicit with the type declarations when making FFI calls by changing the
`usize` parameters to `u32` . Further, make sure that both sides contain the same type
declarations by automatically generating C header files using Rust’s `cbindgen` tool.


Long term, consider leveraging static analysis to flag incorrect usage of FFI types for the
Go/Rust interaction.

However, if the program is too big for the current cache size (but still less than
`MAX_MAKE_SPACE` `)`, then calling `makeSpace` will produce a pop with an empty min heap.


Recommendations
Short term, add a check in `makeSpace` to verify that the program will not exceed the cache
size and return an appropriate error message.


Long term, use fuzzing testing to detect unexpected reverts.
