#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of its Token Bridge Creator. From
December 4 to December 12, 2023, a team of three consultants began a security review of
the Token Bridge Creator’s source code. From December 13 to December 15, 2023, a team
of three consultants began a security review of a PR to the Nitro contract’s codebase.

#### Observations and Impact

Token Bridge Creator is a set of smart contracts used for the atomic and permissionless
deployment of token bridge contracts on top of an existing rollup. Its main use-case is to
make deployment and/or configuration of Orbit L3 chains more convenient. The contract
can be used for both L1<>L2 and L2<>L3 setups.


Additionally, we reviewed a number of small changes to the Nitro Contracts codebase.


In total, we uncovered eight issues, most of which are related to assumptions made by the
design of the protocol. One high-severity issue, TOB-ARB-TBC-002, could allow a malicious
actor to grief the deployment of a bridge. This issue and others were resolved during the fix
review.

## Detailed Findings

1. L2 runtime code does not contain constructor code


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Access Controls Finding ID: TOB-ARB-TBC-001


Target: `contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/L2AtomicTokenBridgeFactory.sol`


Description
Contracts that are being deployed to L2 via retryable tickets on L1 do not include
information on their creation code. This can be dangerous and lead to inconsistencies in
state.


The contracts deployed to L2 are encoded in the `L1TokenBridgeRetryableSender` ’s
`sendRetryable` function.

```
 bytes memory data = abi.encodeCall(
   L2AtomicTokenBridgeFactory.deployL2Contracts,
   (
     L2RuntimeCode(
        l2.routerTemplate.code,
        l2.standardGatewayTemplate.code,
        l2.customGatewayTemplate.code,
        l2.wethGatewayTemplate.code,
        l2.wethTemplate.code,
        l2.upgradeExecutorTemplate.code,
        l2.multicallTemplate.code
        ),
     l1.router,
     l1.standardGateway,
     l1.customGateway,
     l1.wethGateway,
     l1.weth,
     l2StandardGatewayAddress,
     rollupOwner,
     aliasedL1UpgradeExecutor
   )
 );
```

_Figure 1.1: The L2 contracts’ template code is included in a retryable TX._

Trail of Bits 8 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


In order to deploy the code on the L2 side, a generic constructor code is used to deploy the
given runtime code.

```
 // create L2 router logic and upgrade
 address routerLogic = Create2.deploy(
   0, OrbitSalts.UNSALTED, CreationCodeHelper.getCreationCodeFor(runtimeCode)
 );
```

_Figure 1.2: The L1 provided runtime code is wrapped with a generic constructor code._

_(_ _`[L2AtomicTokenBridgeFactory.sol](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts-private/blob/e2537f1f4a04a6de72a08c26ad78d184947a89d2/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/L2AtomicTokenBridgeFactory.sol#L128-L131)`_ _)_


The effect is that the original constructor is stripped away, which can be dangerous and
lead to errors. For example, this could result in the removal of disabling initializers for
proxy implementations, or it could lead to referencing invalid addresses on L2 due to
immutable addresses included in the runtime code that were valid on L1 (e.g., corrupting
the `DelegateCallAware` ’s `onlyDelegated` modifier).


Exploit Scenario
In another upgrade, an implementation contract that is deployed on L2 is left uninitialized.
A malicious user initializes the implementation and is able to self destruct it.


Recommendations
Short term, consider passing in the contract’s creation code instead of the runtime code.


Long term, ensure that all proxy and logic contracts are initialized correctly by adding
further tests to any kind of contract deployed via a ticket.

2. L2 token bridge contract deployment can be griefed


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Denial of Service Finding ID: TOB-ARB-TBC-002


Target: `contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/L2AtomicTokenBridgeFactory.sol`


Description
The retryable ticket deploying the L2 token bridge contracts can fail if the call is front-run
resulting in a blocked state.


When creating the token bridge, `L1AtomicTokenBridgeCreator` sends out two retryable
tickets, one for creating the `L2AtomicTokenBridgeFactory` contract and one for calling
`L2AtomicTokenBridgeFactory.deployL2Contracts` . These tickets are expected to be
atomic in the sense that they are all executed together and guaranteed to succeed.


However, once both retryable tickets are created and pending, a malicious user has the
chance to manually redeem the first ticket, creating the `L1AtomicTokenBridgeCreator`,
and then insert a transaction before the second ticket is redeemed. If the user includes a
call to `L2AtomicTokenBridgeFactory.deployL2Contracts` from any account other
than the expected `L1TokenBridgeRetryableSender`, then the L2 contracts will be
deployed at non-canonical addresses and will not match the addresses stored in the
contract.


The L2 contract addresses are dependent on the sender. This can be seen in the
`_getProxyAddress` function, which computes the address of a
`TransparentUpgradeableProxy` that is deployed by the
`L2AtomicTokenBridgeFactory` using `create2` given the salt calculated from the prefix,
the chain ID, and the sender. This sender is expected to be the
`L1TokenBridgeRetryableSender` .


```
function _getProxyAddress(bytes memory prefix, uint256 chainId)

```

```
  internal
  view
  returns (address)
{

```

```
return Create2.computeAddress(

```

```
   _getL2Salt(prefix, chainId),
   keccak256(
      abi.encodePacked(
        type(TransparentUpgradeableProxy).creationCode,
        abi.encode(

```

Trail of Bits 10 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


```
             canonicalL2FactoryAddress, _predictL2ProxyAdminAddress(chainId),
 bytes("")
          )
        )
     ),
     canonicalL2FactoryAddress
   );
 }

 //...

 function _getL2Salt(bytes memory prefix, uint256 chainId) internal view returns
 (bytes32) {
   return keccak256(
     abi.encodePacked(
        prefix, chainId,
 AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(address(retryableSender))
     )
   );
 }

```

_Figure 2.1: The L2 proxy address is computed. (_ _`[L1AtomicTokenBridgeCreator.sol](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts-private/blob/3c90260961b5fcbee0cc79268e55ccc33701219b/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/L1AtomicTokenBridgeCreator.sol#L488-L533)`_ _)_


The `deployL2Contracts` function can therefore be kept permissionless—since only the
deployments coming from the `L1TokenBridgeRetryableSender` are considered the
canonical ones for the rollup. However, some of the contracts are deployed independently
of the caller, at fixed addresses using an unsalted `create2` call, such as the
`UpgradeExecutor` logic contract.

```
 // Create UpgradeExecutor logic and upgrade to it.
 address upExecutorLogic = Create2.deploy(
   0, OrbitSalts.UNSALTED, CreationCodeHelper.getCreationCodeFor(runtimeCode)
 );
```

_Figure 2.2: The upgrade executor logic is deployed at a fixed address on L2._

_(_ _`[L2AtomicTokenBridgeFactory.sol](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts-private/blob/e2537f1f4a04a6de72a08c26ad78d184947a89d2/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/L2AtomicTokenBridgeFactory.sol#L97-L100)`_ _)_


As the address is fixed, the contract cannot be redeployed to the same address once it has
already been created. This essentially blocks any further calls to `deployL2Contracts` . In
particular, this means that it is possible to block the second retryable ticket (coming from
the `L1TokenBridgeRetryableSender` ) that deploys the contracts at the precomputed
addresses. The result is a mismatch in the stored deployment addresses, requiring a
manual recovery.


Exploit Scenario
Bob, a malicious user, waits for the rollup owner to call `createTokenBridge`, starting the
token bridge deployment process. On the rollup chain, Bob then manually redeems the
first ticket, which creates the L2 token bridge factory, and then calls `deployL2Contracts`


Trail of Bits 11 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


from his own address. The rollup owner is not aware that their call fails. After many failed
bridging attempts, the issue is discovered. The bridged funds are stuck, and the rollup
owner is unable to recreate the L2 token bridge contracts via `createTokenBridge` .


Recommendations
Short term, ensure that the L2 bridge contract creation does not end up being blocked.
Either deploy the currently unsalted contracts using `create1` or make the `create2` salt
dependent on the sender by using `_getL2Salt(OrbitSalts.UNSALTED)` .


Long term, critically examine whether assumptions—such as sending multiple retryable
tickets being atomic—are always valid and whether these can be exploited.

3. Incorrect L2 Multicall address predicted


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Configuration Finding ID: TOB-ARB-TBC-003


Target: `contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/L1AtomicTokenBridgeCreator.sol`


Description
The calculation of the deployment address for the L2 Multicall is incorrect.


The code for `createTokenBridge` predicts that the address of `Multicall` will be
deployed on the L2 using the . `codehash` value of the `Multicall` template.

```
 function _predictL2Multicall(uint256 chainId) internal view returns (address) {
   return Create2.computeAddress(
     _getL2Salt(OrbitSalts.L2_MULTICALL, chainId),
     l2MulticallTemplate.codehash,
     canonicalL2FactoryAddress
   );
 }
```

_[Figure 3.1: The L2 Multicall address is predicted (L1AtomicTokenBridgeCreator.sol)](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts-private/blob/3c90260961b5fcbee0cc79268e55ccc33701219b/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/L1AtomicTokenBridgeCreator.sol#L447-L453)_


A contract’s code hash is the `keccak256` hash of the contract’s runtime code. The `create2`
opcode, however, computes the address using the contract's creation code.


The `Multicall` contract is created using a retryable ticket containing the runtime code
and wraps it with a generic creation code.

```
 // deploy multicall
 Create2.deploy(
   0,
   _getL2Salt(OrbitSalts.L2_MULTICALL),
   CreationCodeHelper.getCreationCodeFor(l2Code.multicall)
 );
```

_Figure 3.2: The Multicall contract is deployed on L2 using_ _`create2`_

_(_ _`[L2AtomicTokenBridgeFactory.sol](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts-private/blob/e2537f1f4a04a6de72a08c26ad78d184947a89d2/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/L2AtomicTokenBridgeFactory.sol#L77-L82)`_ _)_


This disparity causes the `createTokenBridge` contract to predict an incorrect address for
the L2 `Multicall` contract.


It is worth noting that this issue was not discovered during testing because the tests do not
check the initialization of the `L2Multicall` contract properly; etherj’s `[getCode](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/providers/provider/#Provider-getCode)` returns


Trail of Bits 13 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


“ `[0x”](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/providers/provider/#Provider-getCode)` when the account has no code instead of returning empty bytes ( `“”` ). Therefore, the
`expect` statement in figure 3.3 passes for a non-deployed contract (i.e., because
“ `0x”.length` `>` `0` ).

```
 async function checkL2MulticallInitialization(l2Multicall: ArbMulticall2) {
  // check l2Multicall is deployed
  const l2MulticallCode = await l2Provider.getCode(l2Multicall.address)
  expect(l2MulticallCode.length).to.be.gt(0)
 }

```

Exploit Scenario
A user makes RPC `Multicalls` on the rollup using the address stored in the L1 contract.
However, the RPC calls fail because the `Multicall` address is invalid.


Recommendations
Short term, fix the precomputed address calculation or consider using the contract
creation code directly.

```
 function _predictL2Multicall(uint256 chainId) internal view returns (address) {
   return Create2.computeAddress(
     _getL2Salt(OrbitSalts.L2_MULTICALL, chainId),
     keccak256( CreationCodeHelper.getCreationCodeFor( l2MulticallTemplate.code)),
     canonicalL2FactoryAddress
   );
 }
```

_Figure 3.3: The L2 Multicall address prediction is fixed_


Long term, include end-to-end tests checking that the computed address actually matches
the deployed address. Additionally, consider checking that the actual deployed code
matches the expected template instead of checking whether or not the address has code.


Finally, whenever an external API (e.g., etherjs) is used, it is of utmost importance to check
the documentation to ensure that the values returned by the functions are the expected
ones.

4. Rollup owner is assumed to be an EOA


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARB-TBC-004


Target:
```
 contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/{L1AtomicTokenBridgeCreator,L2AtomicT
 okenBridgeFactory}.sol

```

Description
The rollup owner is currently assumed to be an EOA (externally owned account); however,
this is neither explicitly checked nor verified.


Some proxy logic contracts must first be initialized to protect against an unexpected
initialization that can cause the execution of critical operations (e.g., `selfdestruct` ).

```
 // sweep the balance to send the retryable and refund the difference
 // it is known that any eth previously in this contract can be extracted
 // tho it is not expected that this contract will have any eth
 retryableSender.sendRetryable{value: isUsingFeeToken ? 0 : address(this).balance}(

The address is then included as an executor role in the upgrade executor contract.

```
 // init upgrade executor
 address[] memory executors = new address[](2);
 executors[0] = rollupOwner;
 executors[1] = aliasedL1UpgradeExecutor;
 IUpgradeExecutor(canonicalUpgradeExecutor).initialize(canonicalUpgradeExecutor,
 executors);
```

_Figure 4.2: The rollup owner is given the executor role in the upgrade executor_

_(_ _`[L2AtomicTokenBridgeFactory.sol](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts-private/blob/e2537f1f4a04a6de72a08c26ad78d184947a89d2/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/L2AtomicTokenBridgeFactory.sol#L110-L114)`_ _)_


This implicitly assumes that the rollup owner will always be an EOA, as otherwise, if it was a
contract, the address would be aliased to an L2 address. If this were the case, it would not
be able to make the calls to the upgrade executor, because it has stored the unaliased L1
address.


This assumption is not clearly stated and not verified on-chain. In order to prevent
centralization issues, the rollup’s owner should be expected to be a timelock-controlled
multisig contract.


Exploit Scenario
A multisig rollup owner creates a token bridge. The rollup owner is added as an executor to
the upgrade executor. However, the owner is now unable to make any upgrade calls
because the unaliased address has been stored.


Recommendations
Short term, document the assumption that the rollup owner is expected to be an EOA and
consider explicitly checking whether or not the rollup owner is a contract. Additionally, both
the aliased and unaliased address could be given executor control in the upgrade executor.


Long term, revisit assumptions that may not be explicitly stated; include explicit checks for
these, or ensure that no unexpected scenario is created.

5. Depositing before the token bridge is fully deployed can result in loss of
funds


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARB-TBC-005


Target: `contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/L1AtomicTokenBridgeCreator.sol`


Description
If a user triggers a deposit in the L1 side of the token bridge before it is fully deployed, their
deposit will not be executed as expected, and their funds will not be minted on the L2.


Token bridge creation relies on the usage of two retryable tickets that will correctly set up
the L2 side of the bridge.

```
   /**
    * @notice Deploy and initialize token bridge, both L1 and L2 sides, as part of
 a single TX.

```

```
   * @dev This is a single entrypoint of L1 token bridge creator. Function deploys
L1 side of token bridge and then uses
   * 2 retryable tickets to deploy L2 side. 1st retryable deploys L2 factory.
And then 'retryable sender' contract
   * is called to issue 2nd retryable which deploys and inits the rest of the
contracts. L2 chain is determined

```

```
   * by `inbox` parameter.
   *
   * Token bridge can be deployed only once for certain inbox. Any further
calls to `createTokenBridge` will revert

```

```
   * because L1 salts are already used at that point and L1 contracts are
already deployed at canonical addresses

```

```
    * for that inbox.
    */
```

_Figure 5.1: Documentation on the deployment of the token bridge_

However, if the both tickets are not immediately redeemed, a deposit from the L1 will
produce an incomplete deposit in L2.


Exploit Scenario
Alice starts the process of the token bridge deployment. A spike in the L2 activity causes
the retryable tickets not to execute immediately. Bob is eager to use the L2, so he quickly
deposits into the token bridge, even though the bridge is not fully deployed yet. If Bob’s


Trail of Bits 17 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


retryable ticket with the deposit is executed before the L2 of the bridge is ready, the
retryable ticket will call an empty account and it will not revert, leaving Bob without the L2
counterpart of his tokens.


Recommendations
Short term, consider adding a front-end check to verify that the L2 counterpart deployment
has succeeded. Provide a clear error to the client that the token bridge is not yet fully
deployed yet and that any deposit will result in loss of funds.


Long term, review the assumptions of the token bridge during its usage to ensure that the
new deployment will not break any of them.

6. Dangerous aliasing assumption


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARB-TBC-006


Target: `nitro-contracts/src/bridge/AbsInbox.sol`


Description
Applying the L1-to-L2 alias for user-provided addresses depends on L1 contracts, which can
cause aliasing addresses to point to invalid addresses.


Both the `excessFeeRefundAddress` and the `callValueRefundAddress` —two addresses
that the user provides when `createRetryableTicket` is called—are aliased depending
on whether the L1 address contains code.


```
// if a refund address is a contract, we apply the alias to it
// so that it can access its funds on the L2
// since the beneficiary and other refund addresses don't get rewritten by arb-os
if (AddressUpgradeable.isContract(excessFeeRefundAddress)) {

```

```
  excessFeeRefundAddress =
AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(excessFeeRefundAddress);
}
if (AddressUpgradeable.isContract(callValueRefundAddress)) {

```

```
  // this is the beneficiary. be careful since this is the address that can cancel
the retryable in the L2

```

```
   callValueRefundAddress =
 AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(callValueRefundAddress);
 }

```

_Figure 6.1: Aliasing of user provided addresses (_ _`[AbsInbox.sol](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/8c4e7af0026b32aca7daf0a61809495fa93a8504/src/bridge/AbsInbox.sol#L240-L249)`_ _)_


Because it is not possible to reliably determine whether the user wants to use an aliased or
unaliased version of a given L2 address, this step can lead to mistakes by erroneously
applying an alias where it was not expected. This could cause the refund to be sent to a
nonexistent address on L2, where it could be recovered only from its L1 counterpart, which
could be an immutable contract.


Exploit Scenario
The following events occur:


  - Alice (EOA) deploys a random token contract using nonce 0 at address `0xabc` on L1.

  - Alice also deploys a multisig contract using nonce 0 at address `0xabc` on L2.


Trail of Bits 19 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


  - Alice creates a retryable ticket and specifies the `callValueRefundAddress` as the
L2 multisig (at `0xabc` ).

  - The alias check converts `0xabc` to a nonexistent address on L2 due to the unrelated
L1 token contract.

  - Only L1 token contract is able to recover funds, but it does not contain logic to do
so, as it is an immutable token contract.


Recommendations
Short term, clearly document the behavior and make it clear to a user that an alias will
apply in certain cases. Consider not making any assumptions on behalf of the user and
include off-chain checks and validations in a web app.


Long term, consider adding further on-chain checks to ensure that the L1 contract is able
to send retryable tickets and recover the funds when applying an alias.

7. Unclear decimal units of provided amounts


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARB-TBC-007


Target: `nitro-contracts/src/bridge/AbsInbox.sol`


Description
When creating retryable tickets, the caller must provide multiple token values in various
units, which could be prone to errors.


The `createRetryableTicket` function requires the user to provide various parameters in
different units.

```
 function _createRetryableTicket(
   address to,
   uint256 l2CallValue,
   uint256 maxSubmissionCost,
   address excessFeeRefundAddress,
   address callValueRefundAddress,
   uint256 gasLimit,
   uint256 maxFeePerGas,
   uint256 amount,
   bytes calldata data
 ) internal returns (uint256) {
   // ensure the user's deposit alone will make submission succeed
   uint256 amountToBeMintedOnL2 = _fromNativeTo18Decimals(amount);
   if (amountToBeMintedOnL2 < (maxSubmissionCost + l2CallValue + gasLimit *
 maxFeePerGas)) {
     revert InsufficientValue(
        maxSubmissionCost + l2CallValue + gasLimit * maxFeePerGas,
        amountToBeMintedOnL2
     );
   }

   // ...
 )

```

The parameter `amount` is given in the native token’s decimal units. The parameters
`l2CallValue`, `maxSubmissionCost`, and `maxFeePerGas` are denominated using 18
decimal units.


Trail of Bits 21 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


Neither the parameter names nor the NatSpec comments suggest that the values are given
in differing units, which can cause mistakes in integration.


Exploit Scenario
An optimistic cross-chain bridge and AMM protocol is built on top of Arbitrum. When
integrating with an Orbit chain with non-standard decimals, the incorrect decimal units are
hard coded into the token handler contract, causing values that are too high to be sent to
the Orbit chain when bridging the native token.


Recommendations
Short term, consider making a clear distinction between the units depending on the chain.
For example, on L1, all values will always be denominated in the native token’s decimal
units, and on L2, all values will always be denominated using 18 decimal points.


Long term, be aware of confusions that can arise when assumptions in the API are not
clearly documented. Aim to remove the risk of mistakes by focusing on clear usability when
interacting with the bridge contracts.

8. Token values in DeployHelper are not adjusted to token decimals


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ARB-TBC-008


Target: `nitro-contracts/src/rollup/DeployHelper.sol`


Description
The `DeployHelper` contract deploys helper contracts to the L2 chain through retryable
tickets containing hard-coded values that could be chain- and token decimal-dependent.


Certain helper contracts can be deployed in the `DeployHelper` contract as part of the
rollup creation process. These helper contracts are sent via signed transactions.

```
 // Nick's CREATE2 Deterministic Deployment Proxy
 // https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy
 address public constant NICK_CREATE2_DEPLOYER =
 0x3fAB184622Dc19b6109349B94811493BF2a45362;
 uint256 public constant NICK_CREATE2_VALUE = 0.01 ether;
 bytes public constant NICK_CREATE2_PAYLOAD = hex"04f8a58085174876e80083...";
```

_Figure 8.1: Aliasing of user-provided addresses (_ _`[AbsInbox.sol](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/8c4e7af0026b32aca7daf0a61809495fa93a8504/src/bridge/AbsInbox.sol#L240-L249)`_ _)_


Before sending these L2 transactions, a retryable ticket is first created in order to fund the
deployer address.

```
 uint256 feeAmount = _value + submissionCost + GASLIMIT * maxFeePerGas;

 // fund the target L2 address
 if (_isUsingFeeToken) {
   IERC20Inbox(inbox).createRetryableTicket({
     to: _l2Address,
     l2CallValue: _value,
     maxSubmissionCost: submissionCost,
     excessFeeRefundAddress: msg.sender,
     callValueRefundAddress: msg.sender,
     gasLimit: GASLIMIT,
     maxFeePerGas: maxFeePerGas,
     tokenTotalFeeAmount: feeAmount,
     data: ""
   });
 } else {
```

_Figure 8.2: The token total fee amount is being calculated (_ _`[DeployHelper.sol](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/f326c9fe5fe272327b6003ed3834a86a647b5a7d/src/rollup/DeployHelper.sol#L58-L73)`_ _)_


Trail of Bits 23 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


The fee amount is computed in order to cover the L2 value, the submission cost ( `0` in the
case of using a fee token), and the retryable TX gas cost.


When creating a retryable ticket, the `tokenTotalFeeAmount` parameter is expected to be
given in the native token decimal units, as it is converted to 18 decimals. This means that if
the custom fee token’s decimals differ, then the actual token value that is sent will be
miscalculated. When the bridge receives a token value that is too little, it will transfer the
missing funds from `msg.sender` ( `DeployHelper` ), causing the transaction to revert.


Exploit Scenario
Alice creates a new rollup with her custom fee token that uses six decimal points. When
deploying the helper contracts, due to the miscalculation, the `Inbox` requests a large
amount of tokens (0.01e18 * (1e18 - 1e6) = 10M tokens) from the `DeployHelper` . As the
`DeployHelper` has not given any token spending approval to the `Inbox`, this would result
in a transaction failure. If the tokens are manually sent to the `Inbox`, a large part would be
stuck in an unrecoverable address.


Conversely, if the fee token uses decimal points greater than 18, then it is possible that too
little value would be sent for the successful contract creation.


Recommendations
Short term, convert the value given in 18 decimal units to the native token decimal units
(rounded up if needed).


Long term, implement further testing that includes bounds on expected deployment costs.
Additionally, avoid patterns that can cause confusion in function APIs.

Unresolved.


**TOB-ARB-TBC-002: L2 token bridge contract deployment can be griefed**
[Resolved in PR 26 and PR 28. Contracts are no longer being deployed using the unsalted](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts-private/pull/26)
method, which could lead to front-running issues; instead, all contracts include the aliased
retryable sender as part of the deployment salt, therefore linking it with the sender.
Additionally, the ability to resend the L2 deployment retryable ticket has been added which
would help mitigate the scenario in which the original tickets are redeemed out of order
blocking the deployment.


**TOB-ARB-TBC-003** **Incorrect L2 Multicall address predicted**
[Resolved in PR 27, the contract’s runtime code hash is no longer being used to predict the](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts-private/pull/27)
L2 address; instead its creation code is. Additionally, the tests have been updated to check
that the deployed contract code matches that of the expected template and the previous
code length checks have been updated to match etherjs’s behavior.


**TOB-ARB-TBC-004:** **Rollup owner is assumed to be an EOA**
[Resolved in PR 27, the rollup owner is no longer assumed to be an EOA - instead a check is](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts-private/pull/27)
performed to determine whether it's a contract or not and, in the case that it is, the
address is aliased mitigating the issue.
