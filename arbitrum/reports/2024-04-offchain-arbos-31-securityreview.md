#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of a number of Nitro pull requests
(PRs) related to Stylus and BoLD, as described in Project Coverage.


A team of two consultants conducted the review from June 24 to July 1, 2024, for a total of
two engineer-weeks of effort. With full access to source code and documentation a manual
code review processes.

#### Observations and Impact

We reviewed a number of small changes in the Nitro codebase related to Stylus cache costs
and the safe handling of return memory from EVM contracts. Additionally, from the BoLD
side, we reviewed a PR related to the Sepolia deployment and the addition of fast
confirmation support for AnyTrust chains.


We found two issues: a low-severity issue related to an incorrect usage of the Stylus
program version, and a medium-severity issue related to an unexpected failure of AnyTrust
fast node confirmations. Offchain provided fixes for both issues; these were included in the
scope and reviewed during the audit.

## Project Coverage

This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by
our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following PRs:


  - [#2423 and #194 change how to specify programs to cache using their addresses](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/2423)
instead of the codehashes.

  - [#2424 adds a cost for returning data in external calls similar to EVM.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/2424)

  - [#2425 and #333 define](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/2425) a Stylus v2 and prepare the code for an upgrade.

  - [#2426, #2430 and #2436 separate the cached cost from the init cost when using the](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/2426)
program cache.

  - [Individual commits from #193 were also covered:](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/193)

    - [Commit ec065286c6ff04d3854f3c1d4483e17527dca845 specifies Sepolia](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/193/commits/ec065286c6ff04d3854f3c1d4483e17527dca845)
config values.

    - [Commit d6e62dfb7473ecea69a2faecf3e50eccad84efbe includes specific](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/193/commits/d6e62dfb7473ecea69a2faecf3e50eccad84efbe)
Sepolia config addresses.

    - [Commit c60647e83c34bf9955275026807cb1dbf741da6b increases the](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/193/commits/c60647e83c34bf9955275026807cb1dbf741da6b)
number of transactions required to wait for confirmation during Sepolia
deployment.

  - [#187 and #215 allows](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/187) `anyTrustFastConfirmer` role to immediately create and
confirm an assertion, making sure the procedure is resistant to block reorgs.


We reviewed this code for usual flaws in Solidity code as well as any issues that would allow
a malicious to block, delay, or disrupt Stylus or Solidity program execution inside an
Arbitrum rollup. We also reviewed for potential consensus issues introduced by the ArbOS
upgrade that enable these Stylus changes. We also checked for possible misconfiguration
of the new parameters and features in the modified parts of either Stylus and BoLD code.

#### Coverage Limitations

Because of the time-boxed nature of testing work, it is common to encounter coverage
limitations. The following list outlines the coverage limitations of the engagement and
indicates system elements that may warrant further review:


  - We have not reviewed in detail how the Nitro or ArbOS codebases evolved. Instead,
we used the diff/PRs provided by Offchain Labs to bound the scope of this
assessment.


Trail of Bits 7 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


1. Outdated stylus programs can be cached


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-STY-1


Target: `arbos/programs/programs.go`


Description
A Stylus program can be cached to spend less gas the next time it gets called. However, the
property that only updated programs can be cached does not hold for Stylus version 2.


The `SetProgramCached` function performs the actual caching, and one of the
preconditions is that the caching reverts if the program version is 0 and the cache flag is set
to `true` . While this works correctly for Stylus version 1, when it is upgraded to version 2,
the precondition will not catch outdated Stylus programs whose versions are set to 1. This
makes it possible for outdated programs to be cached.

```
 func (p Programs) SetProgramCached(
     emitEvent func() error,
     db vm.StateDB,
     codeHash common.Hash,
     address common.Address,
     cache bool,
     time uint64,
     params *StylusParams,
     runMode core.MessageRunMode,
     debug bool,
 ) error {
     program, err := p.getProgram(codeHash, time)
     if err != nil {
         return err
     }
     expired := program.ageSeconds > am.DaysToSeconds(params.ExpiryDays)

     if program.version == 0 && cache {
         return ProgramNeedsUpgradeError(0, params.Version)
     }
    ...
 }
```

Exploit Scenario
Multiple Stylus programs with version 1 are cached, consuming unnecessary space.


Trail of Bits 8 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

Recommendations
Short term, update the condition to error if the program version is different from the
current Stylus version.


Long term, consider avoiding hard-coding constants when possible. This would remove the
requirement for them to be changed when an upgrade is executed. Instead, use variables
where they need to be changed in a single place.


Trail of Bits 9 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

2. AnyTrust fast confirmation will fail if the confirmer address is not a
validator


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-STY-2


Target: `RollupUserLogic.sol`, `RollupAdminLogic.sol`


Description
The AnyTrust confirmation uses certain validator-only functions that will fail unless the
confirmer address is added as a validator.


AnyTrust confirmation allows privileged users to fast confirm a state of a rollup, if the
[AnyTrust assumptions are met. In order to do that, it is necessary to define a special](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/inside-anytrust)
address as the AnyTrust fast confirmer using the following function:

```
   /**
   * @notice set the anyTrustFastConfirmer address
   * must also call `setValidator` to set the same address as a validator to work
   * old fast confirmer need to be removed from the validator list manually
   * @param _anyTrustFastConfirmer new value of anyTrustFastConfirmer
   */
   function setAnyTrustFastConfirmer(address _anyTrustFastConfirmer) external {
     anyTrustFastConfirmer = _anyTrustFastConfirmer;
     emit OwnerFunctionCalled(31);
   }
```

_Figure 2.1: The_ _`setAnyTrustFastConfirmer`_ _function_


This special user should be able to confirm nodes using the `fastConfirmNextNode` and
`_confirmNextNode` functions:

```
   /**
   * @notice This allow anyTrustFastConfirmer to confirm next node regardless of deadline
   * the anyTrustFastConfirmer is supposed to be set only on an AnyTrust chain to
   * a contract that can call this function when received sufficient signatures
   */
   function fastConfirmNextNode(bytes32 blockHash, bytes32 sendRoot) external whenNotPaused
 {
     require(msg.sender == anyTrustFastConfirmer, "NOT_FAST_CONFIRMER");
     _confirmNextNode(blockHash, sendRoot, true);
   }

   function _confirmNextNode(
     bytes32 blockHash,

```

```
     bytes32 sendRoot,
     bool isFastConfirm
   ) internal {
     requireUnresolvedExists();

     uint64 nodeNum = firstUnresolvedNode();
     Node storage node = getNodeStorage(nodeNum);

     if (!isFastConfirm) {
       // Verify the block's deadline has passed
       node.requirePastDeadline();
     }

     // Check that prev is latest confirmed
     assert(node.prevNum == latestConfirmed());

     Node storage prevNode = getNodeStorage(node.prevNum);
     if (!isFastConfirm) {
       prevNode.requirePastChildConfirmDeadline();
     }

     removeOldZombies(0);
```

…

_Figure 2.2: Snippet of the_ _`_confirmNextNode`_ _and the_ _`fastConfirmNextNode`_ _functions_


However, the `removeOldZombies` function still contains a check that will allow only
validators to execute it:

```
   function removeOldZombies(uint256 startIndex) public onlyValidator whenNotPaused {
     uint256 currentZombieCount = zombieCount();
     uint256 latestConfirmedNum = latestConfirmed();
     for (uint256 i = startIndex; i < currentZombieCount; i++) {
       while (zombieLatestStakedNode(i) < latestConfirmedNum) {
         removeZombie(i);
         currentZombieCount--;
         if (i >= currentZombieCount) {
            return;
         }
       }
     }
   }
```

_Figure 2.3: The_ _`removeOldZombies`_ _function_


Exploit Scenario
A AnyTrust fast confirmer attempts to call `fastConfirmNextNode` but gets a revert
because its address was not previously added as a validator.


Recommendations
Short term, either modify the `fastConfirmNextNode` function to properly add or remove
the AnyTrust fast confirmer addresses, or clearly document the requirement.


Long term, make sure to add tests for each new or modified code before deployment.
