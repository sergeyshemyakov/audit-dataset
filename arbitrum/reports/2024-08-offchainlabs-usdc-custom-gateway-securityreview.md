#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the USDC custom gateway. This
gateway complies with the bridged USDC standard. The contracts can be used by new Orbit
chains that want to provide a USDC bridging solution while maintaining the ability to
upgrade to native USDC at a later point. We also reviewed a small governance action to
upgrade the ArbOS version.


A team of two consultants conducted the review from July 15 to July 23, 2024, for a total of
two engineer-weeks of effort. With full access to source code and documentation, we
performed a manual code review of the code under scope.

#### Observations and Impact

The focus of this audit was the USDC custom gateway. We reviewed the correctness of the
gateway code deployment, the expected deposit and withdrawal workflows, and the
migration workflow toward native token for any possible pitfalls, error-prone steps, or
[underspecified instructions. The USDC custom gateway uses the existing gateway contracts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts)
to implement its functionality, overriding a number of functions. We examined the relevant
inherited code, but we have not audited all of the remaining contracts in that codebase.


During our review, we found a number of corner cases and unspecified/undocumented
situations that could potentially result in funds stuck either before or after the USDC native
migration.

#### Recommendations

As a general recommendation, the Offchain Labs team should review internal and external
documentation for assumptions or requirements regarding the usage of the reference
USDC implementation.

## Detailed Findings

1. Lack of proper scripts to deploy a USDC token in L2


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Denial of Service Finding ID: TOB-USDC-BRIDGE-001


Target: `scripts`


Description
The deployment of the USDC token itself requires a number of conditions that are not
properly checked in the deployment scripts.


The Circle documentation states how the procedure of deployment should account for
certain function calls:

```
 FiatToken has a number of one-time use initialization functions (listed below) that
 are not permissioned, and therefore should be called during contract deployment.
 Due to the proxy pattern used by FiatToken, after (or while) specifying the current
 implementation that the proxy points to, these initialization functions must be
 called to set the values correctly on the proxy's storage. If not, then any caller
 could invoke them in the future.
 It is also recommended to call these functions directly on the implementation
 contract itself, separately from the proxy, to disallow any outside caller invoking
 them later. At the timing of writing, these initialization functions include:

 * initialize
 * initializeV2
 * initializeV2_1
 * initializeV2_2
```

_Figure 3.1: Part of the documentation on the deployment of the FiatToken contract (USDC_

_reference implementation)_


However, it is unclear if the L2 USDC token deployment includes these recommendations.
We have access to only the Sepolia test scripts for local deployment, and these perform
only individual transactions to the proxy:

```
   const l2UsdcFiatToken = IFiatToken__factory.connect(
    l2UsdcProxyAddress,
    deployerL2Wallet
   )
   const masterMinterL2 = deployerL2Wallet

```

```
   await (
    await l2UsdcFiatToken.initialize(
     'USDC token',
     'USDC.e',
     'USD',
     6,
     masterMinterL2.address,
     ethers.Wallet.createRandom().address,
     ethers.Wallet.createRandom().address,
     deployerL2Wallet.address
    )
   ).wait()
   await (await l2UsdcFiatToken.initializeV2('USDC')).wait()
   await (
    await l2UsdcFiatToken.initializeV2_1(ethers.Wallet.createRandom().address)
   ).wait()
   await (await l2UsdcFiatToken.initializeV2_2([], 'USDC.e')).wait()
```

_Figure 2.1: Part of the deployment local scripts_


Additionally, the same calls to the implementation contract are missing.


Exploit Scenario
Alice deploys an L2 USDC token contract in her Arbitrum chain to support the custom token
bridge but forgets to call the initialization functions, allowing any other account to perform
these calls but with other parameters.


Recommendations
Short term, consider using governance actions and dedicated contracts to deploy and
properly configure the L2 USDC token contract in a single transaction.


Long term, review the Circle documentation for additional steps, assumptions, or
requirements regarding the usage of the reference USDC implementation.

2. USDC token bridge contract does not handle certain corner cases


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: Low


Type: Denial of Service Finding ID: TOB-USDC-BRIDGE-002


Target: `L1ArbitrumGateway.sol`, `L2USDCGateway.sol`


Description
The USDC token bridge does not handle special cases, such as when the token itself is
paused or the destination address is denylisted.


The handling of USDC in new chains will be performed using a custom token bridge that
contains specific code for deposits and withdrawals. However, certain interactions are not
handled properly and can result in stuck funds during either the confirmation of deposit or
withdraws. In particular, this can happen if:


  - The USDC contract is paused

  - The recipient of the deposit or the destination of the withdraw is denylisted


For both cases, code that checks for these corner cases is missing. For instance, in the case
of deposits into L2, the final step involves minting USDC:

```
   function inboundEscrowTransfer(address _l2Address, address _dest, uint256
 _amount)
     internal
     override
   {
     IFiatToken(_l2Address).mint(_dest, _amount);
   }
```

_Figure 2.1: The_ _`inboundEscrowTransfer`_ _function from_ _`L2ArbitrumGateway`_


For withdrawals from L2, the final step involves transferring USDC from the bridge to the
destination:

```
   function inboundEscrowTransfer(
     address _l1Token,
     address _dest,
     uint256 _amount
   ) internal virtual {
     // this method is virtual since different subclasses can handle escrow
 differently
     IERC20(_l1Token).safeTransfer(_dest, _amount);

```

```
   }
```

_Figure 2.2: The_ _`inboundEscrowTransfer`_ _function from_ _`L1ArbitrumGateway`_


Both steps will be blocked in the circumstances listed above with no possibility of the users
of undoing their operations.


Exploit Scenario
Alice wants to transfer to Eve. Alice is not sure if Eve’s address is denylisted, but she expects
that if this the case, the operation will revert and she will be able to recover her funds, so
Alice proceeds with the deposit. However, Alice's funds are stuck in the bridge since the
final step of the deposit/withdrawal always reverts.


Recommendations
Short term, consider adding code to properly handle these corner cases, allowing users to
recover their funds (e.g., by undoing the deposit in case the contract is paused or the
destination is denylisted as part of the L2 deposit flow).


Long term, review the Circle documentation for additional steps, assumptions, or
requirements regarding the usage of the reference USDC implementation. Thoroughly
document this behavior so that users are aware of it.

3. Valid USDC in-flight operations are not clearly specified


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Documentation Finding ID: TOB-USDC-BRIDGE-003


Target: Protocol level


Description
The process for migrating to a native token requires a clear specification of the in-flight
operations to avoid miscounting the total supply.


The USDC custom gateway documentation describes how to migrate from bridge USDC to
a native token. In particular, it describes how to deal with unclaimed deposits:

```
 There should be no in-flight deposits when minter role is revoked. If there are any,
 they should be executed (can be done by anyone by claiming the failed retryable
 ticket which does the USDC depositing).
 …
 chain owner reads the total supply of USDC on child chains. Then, he invokes
 setBurnAmount(uint256) on the parent child gateway where the amount matches the
 total supply
 * in case there are unclaimed deposits, their total amount should be added to the
 supply as those tokens shall eventually be minted by child chain gateway
```

_Figure 3.1: Part of the documentation on the migration process to native_


However, extensive documentation on what constitutes an in-flight operation is needed to
avoid confusion when these are counted. In particular, the documentation should include a
procedure to determine if a transaction is a potential deposit/withdrawal or not. A clear
specification should essentially describe how to use events in certain contracts to detect
transactions that are valid deposits/withdrawals. This specification should be used to
match all previous deposits, even the ones that are still in the retryable ticket queue. (These
deposits can be as old as the chain, since retryable tickets can be kept alive indefinitely if
users provide values for them.)


Additionally, the documentation should also explain how to constrain the set of possible
deposits to avoid the following scenarios:


  - Withdrawals/deposits cannot be finalized (e.g., the destination address is
denylisted).

  - Transactions look like deposits/withdrawals, but will always revert.

Exploit Scenario
Eve creates a number of retryable tickets that seem to interact with the USDC custom
bridge in L2. Alice is the chain owner and wants to start the procedure to convert the USDC
to a native token. She miscounts Eve’s transactions as valid deposits and burns an incorrect
amount of tokens.


Recommendations
Short term, expand the documentation to provide a clear specification of in-flight
operations.


Long term, review the internal documentation of each component to identify any gaps or
underspecified sections.

## B. Code Quality Findings

These findings are not issues, but represent opportunities to enhance the security of the
codebase.

**Documentation**

  - The USDC custom gateway can be deployed in Orbit chains where a custom token
fee is used; however, it cannot be used if the USDC itself is the fee token. Add this
behavior to the documentation to avoid confusion.


**Smart Contracts**

  - Beware of isolated changes in code style. The new code uses custom errors while
the old gateways use require statements; this can lead to errors due to differences
in the way conditions are checked (e.g., negative vs. positive conditions).

```
 function initialize(
   address _l1Counterpart,
   address _router,
   address _l1USDC,
   address _l2USDC,
   address _owner
 ) public {
   if (_l1USDC == address(0)) {

```

```
  revert L2USDCGateway_InvalidL1USDC();
}
if (_l2USDC == address(0)) {
  revert L2USDCGateway_InvalidL2USDC();
}
if (_owner == address(0)) {
  revert L2USDCGateway_InvalidOwner();
}

```
