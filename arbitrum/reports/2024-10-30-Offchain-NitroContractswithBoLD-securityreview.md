#### ‭Test Coverage Disclaimer‬

‭All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in‬
‭accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.‬


‭Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be‬
‭provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in‬
‭this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or‬
‭defects in the target system or codebase.‬


‭Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security‬
‭properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but‬
‭each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that‬
‭violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use‬
‭is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.‬

## ‭Project Targets‬

‭The engagement involved a review and testing of the following target.‬


‭Nitro Contracts‬

‭Version‬ `‭acb2fd2703b8bda7c1dc15090d4b09052db4766f‬`


‭Type‬ ‭Solidity‬


‭Platform‬ ‭EVM‬

## ‭Executive Summary‬

#### ‭Engagement Overview‬

‭Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of a number of changes to the‬
‭BoLD contracts.‬


‭A team of three consultants conducted the review from October 21, 2024 to October 25,‬
‭2024, for a total of 2.6 engineer-weeks of effort. With full access to source code and‬
‭documentation, we performed a manual review of the code in scope.‬

#### ‭Observations and Impact‬

‭The scope of the review included only the specific changes made to the BoLD contracts‬
[‭between‬‭6b42a38f‬‭(previously audited)‬‭and‬‭acb2fd2‬‭.‬‭Some of these changes include‬](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/commit/6b42a38f)
‭EIP-7702 support and migration to anyTrustConfirmer (which we audited separately).‬


‭In Ethereum, we classify accounts in two types: externally owned accounts (EOAs) and‬
‭smart contacts. The main difference between the two is that EOAs cannot have code (or‬
‭rather, have empty code). EIP-7702 allows EOAs to set their code, which has a number of‬
‭implications, especially when it comes to the assumptions smart contracts make when‬
‭different accounts interact with them or checks that Solidity itself implements.‬


‭Our testing efforts were focused on identifying possible edge cases related to EIP-7702‬
‭support that could lead to unexpected behavior. Some of the areas we explored included‬
‭address aliasing, retryable tickets, and other general assumptions made by the existing‬
‭contracts, such as the use of‬ `‭fromOrigin‬` ‭methods in‬‭the Nitro contracts. We also reviewed‬
‭the non-EIP-7702-related changes to ensure that no unwanted behavior was introduced.‬


‭The review revealed two informational issues related to address aliasing when EIP-7702 is‬
‭active.‬

#### ‭Recommendations‬

‭We recommend that the client address the findings presented in this report.‬

## ‭Detailed Findings‬

‭1. EOAs addresses can be unexpectedly aliased‬


‭Severity:‬ **‭Informational‬** ‭Difficulty:‬ **‭Low‬**


‭Type: Undefined Behavior‬ ‭Finding ID: TOB-ARB-1‬


‭Target:‬ `‭src/bridge/Inbox‬`


‭Description‬
‭The usage of EIP-7702 when EOAs interact with the Arbitrum contracts in the parent chain‬
‭can trigger unexpected aliasing.‬


[‭EIP-7702‬‭allows EOAs to set their code. If an EOA‬‭has code, the Arbitrum smart contracts in‬](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)
‭the parent chain will treat the address as a smart contract. In particular, for deposits, this‬
‭means that the‬ `‭depositEth‬` ‭function will alias its‬‭origin address and use it as the‬
‭destination of the deposit on the L2 side (figure 1.1).‬

```
 ‭function‬‭depositEth‬‭()‬‭public‬‭payable‬‭whenNotPaused‬‭onlyAllowed‬‭returns‬‭(‬‭uint256‬‭)‬‭{‬
    ‭address‬‭dest‬‭=‬‭msg.sender‬‭;‬

    ‭// solhint-disable-next-line avoid-tx-origin‬
    ‭if‬‭(AddressUpgradeable.isContract(‬‭msg.sender‬‭)‬‭||‬‭tx.origin‬‭!=‬‭msg.sender‬‭)‬‭{‬
      ‭// isContract check fails if this function‬‭is called during a contract's‬
 ‭constructor.‬
      ‭dest‬‭=‬‭AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(‬‭msg.sender‬‭);‬
    ‭}‬

    ‭return‬‭_deliverMessage(‬
      ‭L1MessageType_ethDeposit,‬‭msg.sender‬‭,‬‭abi.encodePacked(dest,‬‭msg.value‬‭),‬
 ‭msg.value‬
    ‭);‬
 ‭}‬
```

_‭Figure 1.1: The‬_ _`‭depositEth‬`_ _‭function‬_ _`[‭(‬‭src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L202-L214‬‭)‬](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/951326d014aa99cbac14c883033dbcab86c85c25/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L202-L214)`_


‭While this is not a problem, as users can eventually use the‬
`‭unsafeCreateRetryableTicket‬` ‭function to move funds,‬‭it may appear as unexpected‬
‭behavior.‬


‭Other instances where an EOA address can be potentially aliased are:‬


‭Trail of Bits‬ ‭8‬ ‭Offchain Labs‬

**‭PUBLIC‬** ‭Security Assessment‬


‭●‬ ‭The‬ `‭msg.sender‬` ‭of the‬ `‭depositERC20‬` ‭function in the‬ `‭ERC20Inbox‬` ‭contract‬


‭●‬ ‭The‬ `‭excessFeeRefundAddress‬` ‭and‬ `‭callValueRefundAddress‬` ‭arguments of the‬

`‭_createRetryableTicket‬` ‭function in the‬ `‭AbsInbox‬` ‭contract‬


‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭Alice calls‬ `‭depositEth‬` ‭from her EOA address with code,‬‭expecting that the funds will be‬
‭deposited to the same address on Arbitrum. However, they are sent to its aliased address.‬


‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, consider clearly documenting that behavior in the UI so users are aware of it.‬


‭Long term, review the implications of EIP-7702 across all the Arbitrum components.‬

‭2. EIP-7702 can break assumptions on address aliasing‬


‭Severity:‬ **‭Informational‬** ‭Difficulty:‬ **‭Low‬**


‭Type: Data Validation‬ ‭Finding ID: TOB-ARB-2‬


‭Target:‬ `‭src/bridge/Inbox‬`


‭Description‬
‭The usage of EIP-7702 both in the parent and the child chain can result in new types of‬
‭interactions regarding address aliasing that were not previously possible in practice, and‬
‭could impact users if they are not aware.‬


‭Address aliasing was introduced in the L2 to avoid unexpected or impossible interactions‬
‭between smart contracts when doing cross-chain transactions.‬


‭These assumptions still hold in practice (except if someone manages to find a private key‬
‭for a smart contract address). However, with the introduction of EIP-7702 in both the‬
‭parent and child chain, these assumptions are no longer valid in practice.‬


‭Specifically, in some cases, EOAs without code are not aliased in the parent chain; however,‬
‭they could have code in the child chain, which effectively turns them into smart contracts‬
‭that require address aliasing.‬


‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, consider enhancing the documentation around the risks associated with‬
‭cross-chain calls when users call EOAs with code.‬


‭Long term, review the implications of EIP-7702 across all the Arbitrum components.‬
