#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the Custom Fee Token
implemented in the PRs detailed in the Project Targets section. These changes allow new
rollups to be deployed using a specific ERC20 implementation that will be used to pay
transaction fees.


A team of three consultants conducted the review from September 21, 2023 to September
29, 2023, for a total of three engineer-weeks of effort. With full access to source code and
documentation, we performed a manual review of the codebase.

#### Observations and Impact

Offchain Labs added a feature to allow rollup owners to select a specific ERC20 token on
the parent chain that will be used to pay for the transaction fees, completely replacing the
use of ETH in the child chain. This new feature requires changes in the token bridge and
ArbOS, including new code to correctly deploy the token bridge in the chain.


We focused on the changes in each PR, but we have not performed a full review of the
repositories involved. We also worked under the assumption that rollup owners will
carefully review the available documentation before deployment, in order to avoid known
issues with certain types of tokens (e.g., rebasing tokens).


This review uncovered two high-severity issues related to the assumptions about how
ERC20 should behave (TOB-ARB-CFT-001) and how funds can flow into the token bridge
contracts (TOB-ARB-CFT-002).

#### Recommendations

We recommend that Offchain Labs fix the reported issues and ensure that the token bridge
documentation is up to date before deployment to ensure that rollup owners use suitable
ERC20 as fee tokens.

## Detailed Findings

1. Double entrypoint or DeFi integrated ERC20 tokens should not be used


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Access Controls Finding ID: TOB-ARB-CFT-001


Target: `src/bridge/ERC20Bridge.sol`


Description
The use of ERC20 tokens with two or more entrypoints can allow an attack to drain the
bridge.


The use of ERC20 tokens for paying fees in the rollup/bridge requires a number of checks
and restrictions to avoid loss of funds. One of these checks is implemented in the bridge
when a withdraw is executed:


```
function _executeLowLevelCall(

```

```
  address to,
  uint256 value,
  bytes memory data
) internal override returns (bool success, bytes memory returnData) {

```

```
     // we don't allow outgoing calls to native token contract because it could
     // result in loss of native tokens which are escrowed by ERC20Bridge
     if (to == nativeToken) {
gvladika marked this conversation as resolved.

```

```
  revert CallTargetNotAllowed(nativeToken);
}

```

```
     // first release native token
     IERC20(nativeToken).safeTransfer(to, value);
     success = true;
     …
```

_Figure 1.1: Header of the_ _`_executeLowLevelCall`_ _function in_
```
              src/bridge/ERC20Bridge.sol

```

Users are not allowed to directly call the native token address; otherwise, they could
transfer funds out. However, this check will not be sufficient if the token has more than one
entrypoint (e.g., when two different addresses can be used to execute ERC20 operations,
such as transfer).


Trail of Bits 8 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


Another problematic type of ERC20 is tightly integrated in DeFi applications. For instance,
[the LUSD ERC20 token contains the following function:](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/liquity-usd/)

```
   function burn(address _account, uint256 _amount) external override {
     _requireCallerIsBOorTroveMorSP();
     _burn(_account, _amount);
   }
```

_Figure 1.2: Burn function from the LUSD token_


This token can be minted or burned through a manager contract (which is different from
the token contract itself), thereby bypassing the above check. In particular, this DeFi allows
LUSD token owners to open, close, or repay vaults, so all of the bridge ERC20 LUSD could
be easily manipulated using the low-level callback without requiring allowances to be set
up.


Exploit Scenario
A user creates a rollup that uses a double entrypoint tokens for fees, allowing any user to
drain the bridge contract.


Recommendations
Short term, clearly document this limitation to make sure of this potential security issue.


Long term, review the assumptions required by ERC20 tokens in order to be integrated in
each component.

2. Token bridge will receive and lock ether


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-ARB-CFT-002


Target: `tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1OrbitERC20Gateway.sol`


Description
The token bridge’s entrypoint for deposits can receive ether, but the token bridge cannot
retrieve it in any way.


Users deposit ERC20 tokens using the `outboundTransfer*` functions from the token
bridge. An example is shown below:

```
  function outboundTransferCustomRefund(
     address _l1Token,
     address _refundTo,
     address _to,
     uint256 _amount,
     uint256 _maxGas,
     uint256 _gasPriceBid,
     bytes calldata _data
   ) public payable override returns (bytes memory res) {
   …
```

_Figure 1.2: Header of the_ _`outboundTransferCustomRefund`_ _function in_
```
     src/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1OrbitERC20Gateway.sol

```

This function will trigger the creation of a retryable ticket, so it needs funds to pay fees and
gas. These fees can be paid using ether or some specific ERC20, but in different token
bridge deployments that share the same interface. In the latter case, the entry function
should not receive ether even though it is payable.


Exploit Scenario
A user accidentally provides ether to a token bridge associated with a rollup that uses a
custom ERC20 token fee. The ether will be locked in the token bridge.


Recommendations
Short term, add a condition that checks the value provided into the `outboundTransfer`
function, and have the function revert if the value is positive.


Long term, review how funds flow from the user to/from different components, and ensure
that there are no situations where tokens can be trapped.

3. Cross-chain message out-of-order execution could affect correct token
bridge deployment


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-ARB-CFT-002


Target: `tokenbridge/ethereum/L1AtomicTokenBridgeCreator.sol`


Description
Out-of-order execution of outbox transactions on L1 and retryable tickets on L2 can lead to
unexpected results when a token bridge is created. This issue relies on the specific ordering
of retryable tickets.


The token bridge creation requires retryable tickets to be submitted and executed in a
certain order:

```
   /**
    * @notice Deploy and initialize token bridge, both L1 and L2 sides, as part of
 a single TX.
    * @dev This is a single entrypoint of L1 token bridge creator. Function deploys
 L1 side of token bridge and then uses
    * 2 retryable tickets to deploy L2 side. 1st retryable deploys L2 factory.
 And then 'retryable sender' contract
    * is called to issue 2nd retryable which deploys and inits the rest of the
 contracts. L2 chain is determined
    * by `inbox` parameter.
    *
    * Token bridge can be deployed only once for certain inbox. Any further
 calls to `createTokenBridge` will revert
    * because L1 salts are already used at that point and L1 contracts are
 already deployed at canonical addresses
    * for that inbox.
    */
   function createTokenBridge(
     address inbox,
     address rollupOwner,
     uint256 maxGasForContracts,
     uint256 gasPriceBid
   ) external payable {
   …
```

```
            L1AtomicTokenBridgeCreator.sol

```

Trail of Bits 11 Offchain Labs Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


However, a malicious user can leverage the out-of-order execution of retryable tickets to
break the assumptions of the token bridge creator and produce a failed deployment.


Exploit Scenario
Alice starts the deployment of a canonical token bridge for a new rollup. Eve notices this
deployment and spams the rollup bridge with transactions to increase the L2 gas cost, and
the tickets are not auto-redeemed. Later, Eve can trigger the tickets out of order to produce
a broken deployment. Alice will not be able to redeploy, and no canonical deployment of
the token bridge can be used.


Recommendations
Short term, consider migrating part of the deployment steps to L2 and require a single
retryable ticket to be executed.


Long term, review all possible ways in which the out-of-order execution of retryable tickets
may affect each component and document.

## B. Development Practices

In this section, we provide best practices regarding code complexity management.


  - When designing smart contracts with the purpose of reuse, try to minimize
inheritance whenever possible, as it often can lead to the creation of multiple levels
of indirection and make the execution flow very hard to follow. While some amount
of inheritance is expected, it can easily be abused.


An example of a complex inheritance structure can be seen when tracing the
internal function calls when creating deposits to `L1OrbitERC20Gateway` :


    - `L1GatewayRouter.outboundTransferCustomRefund`

    - `super` `(L1ERC20Gateway).outboundTransferCustomRefund`

    - `super` `(L1ArbitrumGateway).outboundTransferCustomRefund`

    - `L1ArbitrumGateway._parseUserEncodedData` (overloaded in

L1OrbitERC20Gateway)

    - `L1ArbitrumGateway.calculateL2TokenAddress` (overloaded in

`L1ERC20Gateway` )

    - `L1ArbitrumGateway.getOutboundCalldata` (overloaded in

`L1ERC20Gateway` )

    - `L1ArbitrumGateway._initiateDeposit` (overloaded in

`L1OrbitERC20Gateway` )

    - `L1ArbitrumMessenger.sendTxToL2CustomRefund`

    - `L1ArbitrumMessenger._createRetryable` (overloaded in

`L1OrbitERC20Gateway` )


As shown in figure B.1, the calls jump back and forth between four contracts using
the `super` keyword and function overloading. Abstraction is useful for separating
concerns and reducing code duplication; however, it should not be overused. Too
much abstraction can make following execution traces difficult and introduce
significant mental overhead.

 - When overloading functions, aim to place optional parameters at the end if possible.
This makes it clearer what parameters are optional and reduces cognitive load by
not shifting positions of other parameters too much.
