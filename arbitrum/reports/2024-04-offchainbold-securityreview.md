#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of its Bounded Liquidity Delay
(BOLD) challenge protocol’s updates, an assertion staking pool contract, and the added
delay buffer feature in the sequencer inbox. The BOLD protocol’s implementation has
multiple updates; for example, it is now possible to have multiple big-step levels, each level
can have its own configured mini stake amount, and, in particular, the logic tracking edges’
timers have been changed from top-down to bottom-up. The assertion staking pool
contract allows independent users to stake on a specific assertion by putting together the
minimal token amount needed. The delay buffer feature aims to provide stronger
guarantees of censorship resistance.


A team of two consultants conducted the review from April 8 to April 26, 2024, for a total of
five engineer-weeks of effort. We received the delay buffer’s code towards the end of the
audit, and it was reviewed by one engineer for a total of one engineer-week of effort. With
full access to source code and documentation, we performed static and dynamic testing of
the codebase, using automated and manual processes.

#### Observations and Impact

We spent the majority of our time on the BOLD changes, checking whether any of them
would allow a malicious party to win a challenge by confirmation or prevent an honest
party from winning challenges (e.g., by making it impossible for an honest party to continue
participating in a challenge). We also checked for possible misconfiguration of the new
parameters. We reviewed the assertion staking pool contract to check whether it was
possible to steal tokens, whether a malicious user could change the assertion that the
contract will stake to, and whether the users can withdraw their tokens once the challenge
is finished and won. Finally, we reviewed the delay buffer feature to check whether it
correctly implements the specifications and whether a malicious sequencer could bypass it
and censor transactions.


We did not uncover any serious issues in the implementation. However, we identified areas
for improvement in data validation that would help reduce the attack surface and the
possibility of mistakes (TOB-OFFBOLD-1, TOB-OFFBOLD-2, and TOB-OFFBOLD-3).

#### Recommendations

Based on the findings identified during the security review, Trail of Bits recommends that
Offchain Labs take the following steps:


  - Remediate the findings uncovered during this review.

## Detailed Findings

1. depositIntoPool function allows deposits during ongoing challenges


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-OFFBOLD-1


Target: `contracts/src/assertionStakingPool/AssertionStakingPool.sol`


Description
The `depositIntoPool` function allows depositing tokens even when the assertion was
already created or there are already more tokens than required to create the assertion.

```
 function depositIntoPool(uint256 _amount) external {
    depositedTokenBalances[msg.sender] += _amount;
    stakeToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    emit StakeDeposited(msg.sender, _amount);
 }
```

_Figure 1.1: The_ _`depositIntoPool`_ _function (_ _`[AssertionStakingPool.sol#L43–L47](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/c4e068b568ff662f49ed191c5c3188ea7b6138b2/contracts/src/assertionStakingPool/AssertionStakingPool.sol#L43-L47)`_ _)_


In the best case scenario, where the assertion created wins and all the tokens are returned,
no users would lose tokens. However, tokens deposited when the challenge is ongoing
would allow users’ who previously deposited tokens that are now locked in the challenge to
withdraw their tokens from the new depositor’s tokens.


Exploit Scenario
Alice deposits tokens into the pool, unaware that there is already an ongoing challenge.
Eve, who deposited tokens that are now locked in the challenge, withdraws her tokens
from Alice’s newly deposited tokens. The challenge ends up losing and Alice unknowingly
loses her tokens, instead of Eve.


Recommendations
Short term, in the `depositIntoPool` function, modify the code to validate that the
assertion is not already created and that the current contract’s token balance is less than
what is required to create an assertion.


Long term, when designing a contract that holds users’ tokens, minimize the attack surface
as much as possible by not accepting deposits after a target threshold has been reached.

2. Lack of validation of mini stakes configuration


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-OFFBOLD-2


Target: `contracts/src/challengeV2/EdgeChallengeManager.sol`


Description
The mini stake amounts set during initialization are not validated to decrease for each level
[(from block to single-step execution) despite that expectation being stated in the Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232)
[Improvement Proposal related to BOLD:](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232)


**_Challenge-bonds, per level:_** _3600/1000/100/10 ETH - required from validators to open_
_challenges against an assertion observed on Ethereum, for each level. Note that “level”_
_corresponds to the level of granularity at which the interactive dissection game gets_
_played over, starting at the block level, moving on to a range of WASM execution steps,_
_and then finally to the level of a single step of execution._


The staking configuration is important to disincentivize fraud and make it feasible for an
honest validator to meet the capital requirements for defending assertions.

```
 stakeAmounts = _stakeAmounts;
```

_Figure 2.1: The configuration of bonds is not validated._

Recommendations
Short term, modify the code to validate that the amount of stake required for each level
decreases as the challenge progresses.


Long term, enforce expectations in code to prevent misconfigurations that have important
ramifications on the protocol’s incentives.

3. Potential token incompatibilities in staking pool


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-OFFBOLD-3


Target: `contracts/src/assertionStakingPool/AssertionStakingPool.sol`


Description
The assertion staking pool is not currently reusable and transfers its entire allowance to the
rollup for the `requiredStake` amount. In light of this, the use of the
`safeIncreaseAllowance` function does not pose incompatibilities with tokens such as
USDT, which require the current allowance to be zero when calling the `approve` function.
However, it may be desirable to support reusable assertion staking pools in the future, and
this subtlety should be considered in that event.

```
 function createAssertion() external {
   uint256 requiredStake = getRequiredStake();
   // approve spending from rollup for newStakeOnNewAssertion call
   stakeToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(rollup, requiredStake);
   // reverts if pool doesn't have enough stake and if assertion has already been
 asserted
   IRollupUser(rollup).newStakeOnNewAssertion(requiredStake, assertionInputs,
 assertionHash);
 }
```

Recommendations
Short term, document the potential incompatibility and ensure that each transfer uses the
entire allowance.


Long term, use the `forceApprove` function if the contract is revised to be reusable .

4. Use of incorrect proxy admin contracts


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-OFFBOLD-4


Target: `contracts/src/rollup/BOLDUpgradeAction.sol`


Description
The `upgradeSurroundingContracts` function updates several contracts. However, when
fetching the current implementation of the `getProxyImplementation` function, it uses
the wrong proxy admin contracts for the sequencer inbox and outbox contracts—
`PROXY_ADMIN_BRIDGE` and `PROXY_ADMIN_REI`, respectively.

```
   function upgradeSurroundingContracts(address newRollupAddress) private {

```

```
     // upgrade each of these contracts to an implementation that allows
     // the rollup address to be set to the new rollup address
     ...
     TransparentUpgradeableProxy sequencerInbox =
TransparentUpgradeableProxy(payable(SEQ_INBOX));

```

```
     address currentSequencerInboxImpl =
PROXY_ADMIN_BRIDGE.getProxyImplementation(sequencerInbox);

```

```
     PROXY_ADMIN_SEQUENCER_INBOX.upgrade(sequencerInbox, IMPL_SEQUENCER_INBOX);
     ISequencerInbox(SEQ_INBOX).updateRollupAddress();
     PROXY_ADMIN_SEQUENCER_INBOX.upgrade(sequencerInbox,
currentSequencerInboxImpl);

```

```
     ...
     TransparentUpgradeableProxy outbox =
TransparentUpgradeableProxy(payable(OUTBOX));

```

```
     address currentOutboxImpl = PROXY_ADMIN_REI.getProxyImplementation(outbox);
     PROXY_ADMIN_OUTBOX.upgrade(outbox, IMPL_OUTBOX);
     IOutbox(OUTBOX).updateRollupAddress();
     PROXY_ADMIN_OUTBOX.upgrade(outbox, currentOutboxImpl);
   }
```

_(_ _`[BOLDUpgradeAction.sol#L388–L415](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/b6522c0ef9f8e721a48cb0256ce11e939d9133b3/contracts/src/rollup/BOLDUpgradeAction.sol#L388-L415)`_ _)_


Given that the implementation of the `getProxyImplementation` function does not use
any state-related variables (figure 4.2), the mistake does not cause a divergence and the
result is the same as if the correct proxy admin contracts were used.

```
  function getProxyImplementation(TransparentUpgradeableProxy proxy) public view
 virtual returns (address) {
     // We need to manually run the static call since the getter cannot be

     (bool success, bytes memory returndata) =

```

```
  require(success);
  return abi.decode(returndata, (address));
}

```

Recommendations
Short term, when calling the `getProxyImplementation` function for the sequencer inbox
and outbox, use the `PROXY_ADMIN_SEQUENCER_INBOX` and `PROXY_ADMIN_OUTBOX`
contracts `,` respectively.


[Long term, since the 5.0.0 release of the OpenZeppelin library has deprecated the](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v5.0.0)
`getProxyImplementation` function, the code will eventually need to fetch the values
from storage.

5. Unused custom errors


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-OFFBOLD-5


Target: `src/libraries/Error.sol`


Description
The custom errors declared in figure 5.1 are unused. It is unclear whether they are dead
code or errors that should be raised; however, they are never used due to missing checks.

```
 /// @dev Thrown when atleast one new message must be read.
 error NotDelayedFarEnough();
 ...
 /// @dev Thrown when a batch post fails to prove a message delivery and sequencing
 are synced within the delay threshold
 error UnexpectedDelay(uint64 delayBlocks);
```

Recommendations
Short term, remove these errors if they are unused, or apply the correct checks.


Long term, thoroughly document the different error types and when they should be used
and why; review the code to correct any divergences.

6. Misuse of expectRevert cheat code hides test failing


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Testing Finding ID: TOB-OFFBOLD-6


Target: `test/foundry/DelayBuffer.t.sol`


Description
The `testUpdateDepleteAndReplenish` test uses the `expectRevert` cheat code with a
call to a library’s internal function. This cheat code should be used only with external
function calls because it cannot track calls to internal functions. In this instance, if the test
is run with verbosity turned on, the test stops and passes, as shown in figure 6.1.

```

_Figure 6.2: Running_ _`testUpdateDepleteAndReplenish`_ _without_ _`expectRevert`_


The purpose of this test is to consume a small amount of buffer and then replenish it, but
the check for the latter state is failing, as shown in figure 6.3.

```
   delayBuffer.update(25);

   assertEq(delayBuffer.prevBlockNumber, 25);
   assertEq(delayBuffer.prevSequencedBlockNumber, configBufferable.threshold + 11);
   assertEq(delayBuffer.bufferBlocks, configBufferable.max);
```

_Figure 6.3: Snippet of the test (_ _`[DelayBuffer.t.sol#L189–L193](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/3f8e71106a5be82f6a9ab033165a0cb8ae7e51aa/test/foundry/DelayBuffer.t.sol#L189-L193)`_ _)_


The test is run with the `replenishRateInBasis` variable set to `714` and a buffer
maximum of `14400` . When the `delayBuffer.update(25)` function is executed (figure
6.3), the `prevBlockNumber` variable equals 24. The buffer is updated in the `calcBuffer`
function (figure 6.4), where `end` is the argument passed to the `update` function (in our
case, 25) and `start` is the currently set `prevBlockNumber` (in our case, 24). The `elapsed`
variable will equal 1 then. However, rounding the operation down causes the test to fail
because it adds `0` to the buffer variable.

```
    uint256 elapsed = end > start ? end - start : 0;
    uint256 delay = sequenced > start ? sequenced - start : 0;
    // replenishment rounds down and will not overflow since all inputs including
    // replenishRateInBasis are cast from uint64 in calcPendingBuffer
    buffer += (elapsed * replenishRateInBasis) / BASIS;
```

_Figure 6.4: Snippet of the_ _`calcBuffer`_ _function (_ _`[DelayBuffer.sol#L43–L47](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/3f8e71106a5be82f6a9ab033165a0cb8ae7e51aa/src/bridge/DelayBuffer.sol#L43-L47)`_ _)_


The correct way to test whether a replenish of exactly 1 occurs (i.e., from `13999` to `14000` )
is to call the `update` function with an argument that is exactly equal to `prevBlockNumber`


Trail of Bits 16 Offchain BOLD and Delay Buffer Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


+ 15 because `elapsed` will be 15 and is the first value in the calculation for adding to the
buffer that rounds down to `1` and not `0` .


Recommendations
Short term, to make the test pass, correct the test to not use `expectRevert` with internal
calls and to pass 39 as the argument for the last call to the `update` function.


Long term, use mutation testing to validate the correctness of the testing suite or identify
possible improvements (see appendix B).

## B. Mutation Testing

During our review, we ran two mutation testing tools, Necessist and `slither-mutate`, to
identify potential shortcomings in the test suite and implementation.


[To use Necessist, run the following command:](https://github.com/trailofbits/necessist)

```

To use `[slither-mutate](https://github.com/crytic/slither/blob/master/slither/tools/mutator/README.md)`, run the following command:

```
   slither-mutate src/challengeV2/EdgeChallengeManager.sol
   --test-cmd='forge test --match-contract="EdgeChallengeManager"'

```

After reviewing the results, we identified missing test coverage for the following error case:

```
 if (args.endHistoryRoot != claimStateData.assertionState.endHistoryRoot) {
   revert EndHistoryRootMismatch(args.endHistoryRoot,
 claimStateData.assertionState.endHistoryRoot);
 }
```

We have provided a test that eliminates this gap and ensures regressions will be identified,
as shown in figure B.2.

## C. Analysis of Bottom-Up Timers

This iteration of the BOLD protocol removed the notion of edges inheriting their ancestor’s
timers and in its place introduced bottom-up timers. The following rules and description
explain this concept in terms of dominance relations from graph theory. Parent nodes
accumulate the unrivaled time according to two rules:


1. If an edge immediately dominates a layer zero edge, count the maximum of its
successors’ unrivaled time towards its own unrivaled time.


2. Otherwise, count the minimum of its successors’ unrivaled time towards its own
unrivaled time.


To accumulate the timers bottom-up, a validator can perform a reverse post order traversal to
propagate the timers upward through the graph, confirming edges that have sufficient
unrivaled time. (Note: only one rival can be confirmed.) If there is a path from (V,E) such that
the sum of all unrivaled times (not the cached total) of nodes dominated by V and
post-dominated by E and E itself is greater than or equal to the challenge period, V can be
confirmed.

## D. Code Quality Recommendations

The following recommendations are not associated with specific vulnerabilities. However,
implementing them may enhance code readability and prevent the introduction of
vulnerabilities in the future.


  - **Simplify machine status condition.** The condition is checking that the machine
status is not the `ERRORED` state. The machine status can have three states, and at
the start of this function, there is a check to validate whether the machine status is
`ERRORED` or `FINISHED` . Ensure that this check is equal to `FINISHED` so it is clear
which status should enter the branch.

```
     if (assertion.afterState.machineStatus != MachineStatus.ERRORED &&
     afterStateCmpMaxInbox < 0) {
```

  - **Improve emission of custom error.** The `EdgeNotExists` error is used in this
[instance where it should be an unreachable case. Using a different error specific for](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/582f3f055774fe9f0b2c4f27f8cacbd9fadf9f37/contracts/src/challengeV2/libraries/EdgeChallengeManagerLib.sol#L535)
an unreachable case would improve debugging.


  - **Correct typo.** [The error message should be](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/9d0d70341af08b6f8a7255cd7d16695344e726f2/contracts/src/rollup/BOLDUpgradeAction.sol#L470) `UNEXPECTED_ROLLUP_ADDR` instead of
`UNEXPCTED_ROLLUP_ADDR` .


  - **Do not return a value from a function if it is not needed.** The
`[updateTimerCache](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/582f3f055774fe9f0b2c4f27f8cacbd9fadf9f37/contracts/src/challengeV2/libraries/EdgeChallengeManagerLib.sol#L484-L493)` function returns a Boolean value, but in the places where it is
called, it is not used.


**●** **Update documentation:**


    - The `[confirmEdgeByTime](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/582f3f055774fe9f0b2c4f27f8cacbd9fadf9f37/contracts/src/challengeV2/EdgeChallengeManager.sol#L72-L80)` function still has edges that inherit time from
parents.


    - The `[BufferData](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/3f8e71106a5be82f6a9ab033165a0cb8ae7e51aa/src/bridge/DelayBufferTypes.sol#L19-L34)` structure has the wrong arguments in the NatSpec
comments.


    - Various comments for the `[update](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/3f8e71106a5be82f6a9ab033165a0cb8ae7e51aa/src/bridge/DelayBuffer.sol#L66-L80)` function mention a `prev` delay, but this
should have been replaced with `prevBlockNumber` .


**●** **Improve imports:**


    - The `DelayBuffer` [library imports custom errors that are not used.](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/3f8e71106a5be82f6a9ab033165a0cb8ae7e51aa/src/bridge/DelayBuffer.sol#L7)


    - The `NotDelayBufferable` [error is imported twice in the](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/3f8e71106a5be82f6a9ab033165a0cb8ae7e51aa/src/bridge/SequencerInbox.sol#L33-L36) `SequencerInbox`
contract.

## E. Work Towards Formal Specification

During our review, we experimented with developing specifications in the Certora
Verification Language (CVL) and checking them with the Certora Prover. We recommend
reviewing and adapting these specifications as needed. Because of errors returned in the
prover and the potential for unsound/vacuous rules (e.g., over-constraining preconditions),
we do not claim that these rules have formally proven these desired properties of the
implementation.


The rule `noTwoRivalsCanBeConfirmed` starts with an unconfirmed edge, A; allows the
prover to model any call sequence; and then asserts that there is no rival of A that is also
confirmed.


The rule `rivalsHaveSameLength` starts with an edge, X; allows the prover to model any
call sequence; and then asserts that there is no rival of X that has a history commitment
with a different length.
