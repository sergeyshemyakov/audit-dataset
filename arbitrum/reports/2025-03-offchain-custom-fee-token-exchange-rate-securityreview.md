## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the changes made to the Nitro
contracts to support an exchange rate for the custom fee token. These changes correspond
[to PR #252 (](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/252) `c4ee8b8` [) and PR #281 (](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/281) `13f2cac` ).


The commits in scope involve a number of changes that allow Arbitrum rollups using
ERC-20 tokens as a fee token to properly reimburse the batch poster. Essentially, the gas
price needs to be adjusted based on the relative price of the custom token. In order to
compute this price, a number of alternatives are offered for the rollup owners to
implement, from manually adjusted fixed prices to complex oracles based on external data.
Only the infrastructure smart contract–related changes were in scope, so testing and
example code was excluded.


A team of two consultants conducted the review from February 5 to February 10, 2025, for
a total of five engineer-days of effort. With full access to source code and documentation,
we performed a manual review of the code in scope.

#### Observations and Impact

This engagement did not reveal any issues in the code in scope. However, we provide some
recommendations for improving the code quality in the Code Quality Recommendations
appendix.

#### Recommendations

Based on the security review, Trail of Bits recommends that Offchain Labs take the
following step:


●​ Review the items in the Code Quality Recommendations appendix and consider
taking action on each one.

## A. Code Quality Recommendations

The following is a list of findings that were not identified as immediate security issues but
may warrant further investigation.


●​ The batch poster will need additional trust assumptions if they can directly or
indirectly influence the exchange rate for getting refunds. While this is documented
in the `fee-token-pricer` [README, it must also be included in the official](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/sequencer)
[sequencer/batch poster documentation.](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/sequencer)


●​ Be careful while moving the storage variables in upgradeable smart contracts to
avoid storage slot collision risks. The `buffer` storage variable has been moved from
the last position to above all the immutable variables. This movement does not
introduce storage collision vulnerabilities because immutable variables are not
stored in the storage slots.

#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.
