#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Optimism engaged Trail of Bits to review the testing strategy of its Optimistic Rollup engine,
Optimistic L2 `go-ethereum` fork, and Bedrock smart contracts. From August 22 to
September 23, 2022, a team of two consultants conducted a review of the client-provided
source code, with eight person-weeks of effort. Details of the project’s timeline, test targets,
and coverage are provided in subsequent sections of this report.

#### Project Scope

Our testing efforts were focused on the identification of flaws that could result in a
compromise of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the target system. We conducted
this audit with full knowledge of the system, including access to the source code and
documentation. We performed automated analysis against the project targets, as
described in the Automated Testing section of the report.

#### Summary of Findings

The audit uncovered a significant flaw that could impact system confidentiality, integrity, or
availability. A summary of this finding is provided below.

#### Notable Finding

The significant flaw that impacts system confidentiality, integrity, or availability is described
below.


   - TOB-OPTEST-1

The `GasPriceOracle` contract deployed to L2, which is used to update L1 costs
charged on L2, could be misconfigured in a way that sets gas prices high enough to
prevent transactions from being processed. Certain misconfigurations may even
block future attempts to reset the `GasPriceOracle` .

## Project Goals

The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of the Optimism team’s
`op-geth`, `op-node`, and Bedrock smart contracts. Specifically, we sought to answer the
following non-exhaustive list of questions:


   - Which invariants across the project targets should be tested to best ensure the

targets’ security?


   - Does the existing testing methodology contain gaps that could cause tests to miss

security-critical issues?


   - Could any of the existing unit tests be better served with an accompanying fuzz test?


   - [How could the Slither API be used to statically analyze smart contracts within](https://github.com/crytic/slither/)

Optimism?


   - Could the testability of certain targets be improved in any way?


   - Generally, does the system behave as expected when tested under various

conditions?


         - Are blocks produced in a timely fashion?


         - Are access controls in place to prevent users from submitting deposit

transactions through the L2 RPC endpoint?


         - Does the system work end to end? Do the individual components of `op-geth`

and `op-node` behave as expected?


         - Are data structures serialized and deserialized without data loss?


         - Are balances and fees charged as expected?


         - Does the system behave as expected when forks are encountered?

## Project Coverage

This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by
our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:


   - Documentation of invariants within the `OptimismPortal` Bedrock smart contract

and its relevant subcomponents, such as `ResourceMetering`


   - Documentation of invariants across the `op-node` subproject of the `optimism`

monorepo related to smart contracts and `op-node` functionality


   - Documentation of invariants across the `op-geth` project


   - Verification of various invariants throughout the project’s unit, integration, and

property tests, which resulted in the following:


         - Testing the round-trip serialization of objects across `op-node` and `op-geth`

did not result in the discovery of any new vulnerabilities.


         - Verification of the L1/L2 gas fee computation revealed that the

`GasPriceOracle` contract could be misconfigured in a way that sets
unreasonably high transaction fees, preventing L2 transaction submissions
from being accepted ( TOB-OPTEST-1 ).


         - The block production and fee computations were not tested for all potential

configuration permutations of `op-node` and `op-geth` ; nonetheless, while
running tests during the audit, we did not find these computations to be
problematic.


         - The access controls intended to prevent users from submitting deposit

transactions through the L2 RPC endpoint were found to be effective.


         - Fuzz testing the system’s data structures, such as `go-ethereum` transactions

(including the new deposit transaction type) and `BatchData` in the `op-node`
subproject, found that they are encoded/decoded successfully without data
loss.


         - Verification of transfer-related invariants found that the system handles

transfers as expected: attempting to transfer more ETH on L2 than an
account owner holds results in errors, while attempting to transfer less than
an account owner holds results in the expected transfer of the requested
ETH.


Trail of Bits 9 Optimism Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


         - Verification of the `OptimismPortal` contract’s deposit routines and

inherited contract methods found that they behave as expected in terms of
burning ETH, hashing, constructing proofs, aliasing addresses for deposits,
enforcing gas metering, and more.

#### Coverage Limitations

Because of the time-boxed nature of testing work, it is common to encounter coverage
limitations. The following list outlines the coverage limitations of the engagement and
indicates system elements that may warrant further review:


   - We were unable to perform additional testing of system interactions in a concurrent

fashion (e.g., cascading deposits/withdrawals asynchronously to ensure the state
machine behaves as expected).


   - Not all invariants across the system could be documented.


We recommend that the Optimism team take the following steps to mitigate coverage
limitations in future audits and testing:


   - Further derive invariants from any off-chain smart contract tests and follow up on

additional invariants related to the operation of transaction pools, block
construction, P2P operations, payload attribute derivation, and fork conditions.


   - Continue writing fuzz tests for all existing unit tests that do not have an

accompanying fuzz test. This will ensure that additional conditions or values that are
hard-coded within the unit tests undergo additional scrutiny.

## Automated Testing

Trail of Bits uses automated techniques to extensively test the security properties of
software. We use both open-source static analysis and fuzzing utilities, along with tools
developed in house, to perform automated testing of source code and compiled software.

#### Test Harness Configuration

We used the following tools in the automated testing phase of this project:


**Tool** **Description**


[Slither](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither) A static analysis framework that can statically verify algebraic relationships
between Solidity variables


[Echidna](https://github.com/trailofbits/echidna) A smart contract fuzzer that can rapidly test security properties via
malicious, coverage-guided test case generation


`[go test](https://pkg.go.dev/testing)` A first-party unit- and property-testing framework for Golang

#### Test Results

The results of testing the system properties that we enumerated during the audit are

transactions through as expected.


In the event of a large number of forced
transactions, the transaction pool continues to
operate, and standard Ethereum transactions
in the transaction pool do not expire or
become stale.


Deposit transactions that fail to transfer value
on L2 (e.g., because of insufficient balance) do
not negatively affect valid deposit transactions.


Failed withdrawal transactions do not prevent
valid withdrawal transactions from executing
(end to end).


Withdrawals that specify an invalid timestamp,
such as one for which an L2 output root does
not exist or is not `FINALIZATION_PERIOD`
seconds old, are rejected.


The `sender`, `target`, `message`, `value`, and
`gasLimit` fields cannot be modified in a
withdrawal request without failure.


Failed deposits on L1 that are then reorganized
to be successful deposits are handled
appropriately by L2.


Different verifiers are not able to derive
different fees.

## Detailed Findings

1. Risk of misconfigured GasPriceOracle state variables that can lock L2


Severity: **Undetermined** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-OPTEST-1


Target:
`optimism/packages/contracts/L2/predeploys/OVM_GasPriceOracle.sol`,
```
 op-geth/core/rollup_l1_cost.go

```

Description
When bootstrapping the L2 network operated by `op-geth`, the `GasPriceOracle` contract
is pre-deployed to L2, and its contract state variables are used to specify the L1 costs to be
charged on L2. Three state variables are used to compute the costs— `decimals`,
`overhead`, and `scalar` —which can be updated through transactions sent to the node.


However, these state variables could be misconfigured in a way that sets gas prices high
enough to prevent transactions from being processed. For example, if `overhead` were set
to the maximum value, a 256-bit unsigned integer, the subsequent transactions would not
be accepted.


In an end-to-end test of the above example, contract bindings used in `op-e2e` tests (such
as the `GasPriceOracle` bindings used to update the state variables) were no longer able
to make subsequent transactions/updates, as calls to `SetOverhead` or `SetDecimals`
resulted in a deadlock. Sending a transaction directly through the RPC client did not
produce a transaction receipt that could be fetched.


Recommendations
Short term, implement checks to ensure that `GasPriceOracle` parameters can be
updated if fee parameters were previously misconfigured. This could be achieved by
adding an exception to `GasPriceOracle` fees when the contract owner calls methods
within the contract or by setting a maximum fee cap.


Long term, develop operational procedures to ensure the system is not deployed in or
otherwise entered into an unexpected state as a result of operator actions.

## B. Testing the Project Targets

This section describes how to execute the tests that Trail of Bits ran during the
engagement.

#### Echidna Fuzz Tests (Bedrock Contracts):

Echidna is an Ethereum smart contract fuzzer that allows users to write on-chain property
tests to verify the expected states of their applications.


We provided Git patches for each project target alongside the report containing the tests
generated during the course of the assessment. To prepare the environment for fuzz
testing, we removed the `optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/test`
directory, as it contained unlinked libraries that are incompatible with Echidna in a default
deployment scheme. Additionally, we updated the Hardhat and Foundry compilation
configurations so that they did not strip bytecode hash metadata, which is required by
Echidna to match deployed contracts.


To run the Echidna fuzz tests, take the following steps:


   - To compile the project, invoke Hardhat in the

`optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock` directory by running the following
commands:


         - `npx hardhat clean`


         - `npx hardhat compile`


   - Invoke Echidna against a contract containing property tests by running the following

command. This will tell Echidna to use the previously created compilation and to
target the provided contract in a fuzzing campaign:

```
   echidna-test --contract <contract_name> --crytic-args
   --hardhat-ignore-compile .

#### Go Test Tests (op-node, op-e2e, op-geth)
```

The `go test` command invokes unit, integration, and fuzz tests written using Golang’s
native `testing` package. We produced unit and fuzz tests for `op-node` and `op-geth`, as
described in the Automated Testing table.


   - To run the end-to-end tests within the `optimism/op-e2e` directory and the

`op-node` unit tests within the `optimism/op-node` directory alongside any existing
tests, run the following command from the respective directories:

      - `go test -v ./…`


- To run individual unit tests, use the following command instead:


      - `go test -v -run <TestName>`


- To run fuzz tests written for `op-node` and `op-geth`, run the following command

from the directory containing the test file. The tests will run until the process is killed
or interrupted:


      - `go test -v -fuzz <TestName>`

## C. Recommendations for Improving Testability

This section includes recommendations for improving the testability of the codebase.

#### Solidity Smart Contract Testing

   - To use on-chain property fuzzers, such as Echidna, property tests are written in

Solidity. However, on-chain property tests cannot access various aspects of the
chain state or results. Therefore, we recommend designing functionality in a way
that allows the results to be tested on-chain.


   - To ensure that all of the routines in a given contract can be tested, verify that the

relevant inputs, state changes, and outputs can be captured by a separate method
in the contract. For instance, emitted events cannot be queried on-chain; they can
be verified only off-chain.


         - If a test intends to verify values within an emitted event, consider splitting

the relevant method into a helper function that returns the values rather
than emitting them in an event. The original method could use this helper
function to perform the underlying work and later emit the output data in an
event itself, while test methods could target the helper directly to verify
output methods.


              - For example, one could split the

`OptimismPortal.depositTransaction` logic into a helper method
that returns values rather than simply emitting a log, as these values
can be validated by a test using the helper method. Alternatively, one
could wrap the emitted event in a separate virtual function that can
be overridden by a test contract derived from `OptimismPortal` so
that it can capture these values.


   - Ensure that the contracts can be easily deployed from a separate contract where

possible. Echidna deploys compiled contracts with no constructor arguments and
executes transactions against publicly accessible methods in an attempt to produce
state changes.


         - For contracts that take constructor arguments, consider either creating a

deriving contract that satisfies the constructor arguments with hard-coded
values or creating a separate contract to deploy such contracts with the
appropriate constructor arguments used for testing.


              - Carefully consider the tested contracts’ code composition when

making such decisions.


Trail of Bits 31 Optimism Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


         - [For complex contract developments, consider using Etheno alongside](https://github.com/crytic/etheno)

Echidna.


   - Consider integrating the project’s Echidna fuzz tests to the project’s CI/CD pipeline,

[possibly through the use of Echidna GitHub Actions .](https://github.com/crytic/echidna-action)


         - Leverage the `test-limit` configuration variable to limit the duration of the

fuzzing campaign in the CI process.


         - Ensure that the fuzz tests are run at regular intervals. Tests that pass do not

necessarily indicate a lack of vulnerabilities. The constraints required to
violate a property test may not be found in one run, but the fuzzer may catch
the latent issue in a later run.


   - Consider adding rules to Slither’s existing set of static analysis rules by plugging

detectors or other custom scripts into Slither’s detector API. To observe how the
Slither API can be used to verify the integrity of a codebase, run the following
command from the `optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock` directory:

```
       python3 ./slither_api_example.py

```

As a proof of concept, this script discovers all Echidna property tests and the
contracts they live within, specifies the contracts that they immediately inherit from,
and performs a check against `OptimismPortal.depositTransaction` to ensure
that no high-level calls were added/removed and that an `if` statement exists for
`_isCreation` that contains only a `require` statement comparing `_to` to
`address(0)` .


Note that the test against `OptimismPortal` was written to check every AST node
and its underlying IR to show how Slither can be used to iterate over every
statement or expression in a method and detect specific patterns or variables
across multiple expressions. However, the test could be simplified to instead check
the source text for specific segments.


The use of the Slither API can enable the CI/CD pipeline to catch issues that arise
from changes mistakenly introduced by developers, such as changes that violate
some property of a given method. For instance, a Slither script could be written to
differentiate between internal and external calls to ensure that no external calls are
performed in a given method.

#### L1/L2/op-node Testing

   - We recommend creating an API that simplifies the project’s end-to-end testing.:


Trail of Bits 32 Optimism Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


      - The API should provide methods to initialize accounts with different balances

on L1 and L2 and provide a simplified test account structure with the key
path, private key, and `TransactOpts`, alongside other account properties.


      - The API should ensure that timeout-based tests do not fail simply because

the timeouts are set too low. For example, throughout the `op-e2e` tests,
various statements wait one second for a block to propagate, which may not
be long enough. Increasing the timeout may reduce the likelihood of
false-positive test failures for slower systems (such as the CI process).


      - The API should include methods to execute actions such as sending deposit

transactions, sending withdrawal requests, creating arbitrary transfer
transactions on L1/L2, and causing fork conditions on L1/L2. The testing
harness could automatically execute these actions and update expected
values, such as expected balances/nonces on L1/L2, which are automatically
asserted at the end of the test alongside any conditions that the tester
asserts within the test immediately.


           - Simulating fork conditions may require support for rolling back

previous actions (and their changes to expected values).


           - Ideally, the system should allow these actions to be invoked in parallel

(from goroutines) to simulate typical network behavior (e.g., multiple
L1 deposit transactions submitted at once).


           - The system should ensure that blocks produced in tests simulate

conditions for multiple Optimism system–related transactions
included both simultaneously and individually in a single block.


           - Consider writing all relevant end-to-end tests so that they can be run

against various system configurations, such as differing sequence
windows and gas fees.


      - Finally, the API should ensure that the same test can be easily rerun with

differing system configurations; this will ensure that the system does not
exhibit undefined behavior as a result of edge cases arising from various
configurations.


- For unit tests that depend on the result of processing certain data and making sure

routines succeed or fail as expected, ensure that as many permutations of the input
data as possible are tested. Review the existing unit tests to identify hard-coded
values that would increase test coverage if they were randomized or fuzzed values
instead.


Trail of Bits 33 Optimism Security Assessment

      - For example, some unit tests within `op-node` depend on the

`MarshalDepositLogEvent` method to produce a deposit event that is used
as input to test deposit derivation functions. By reviewing this method, we
can see that deposit versions are hard-coded to valid values. Modifying the
unit tests’ helper methods to accept additional fields (such as the deposit
version field) will add the flexibility necessary to test additional invariants
(such as whether deposit logs with an invalid version produce derived
deposits).
