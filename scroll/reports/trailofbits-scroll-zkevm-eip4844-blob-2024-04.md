‭Trail of Bits‬ ‭4‬ ‭Scroll ZkEVM EIP-4844 Blob‬‭Security Assessment‬

**‭PUBLIC‬**


## ‭Executive Summary‬

#### ‭Engagement Overview‬

‭Scroll engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the new halo2 circuits to be integrated‬
‭into Scroll’s ZkEVM. These circuits enable the use of blob-carrying transactions in‬
‭accordance with the EIP-4844 specification.‬


‭A team of three consultants conducted the review from April 1 to April 16, 2024, for a total‬
‭of six engineer-weeks of effort. Our review efforts focused on the soundness and‬
‭completeness of the modifications made to the ZkEVM and the aggregator implementation‬
‭to use blob-carrying transactions, as well as circuit soundness and completeness in‬
‭accordance with the EIP-4484 specification. With full access to source code and‬
‭documentation, we performed static and dynamic testing of the codebase, using‬
‭automated and manual processes.‬

#### ‭Observations and Impact‬

‭We identified one high-severity issue that would allow a malicious sequencer to create‬
‭batches that can be finalized in two different ways. In addition, we found six informational‬
‭issues. Although the informational issues do not directly cause exploitable problems,‬
‭several of them have the potential to cause catastrophic failure if the codebase changes‬
‭slightly. In most cases, there is no specific documentation or clear programming pattern to‬
‭prevent such changes.‬


‭The modules that have been modified to support EIP-4844, especially the aggregator and‬
‭the transaction circuit, are exceptionally complex and interact broadly across the codebase.‬
‭The current implementation is brittle, and we believe that some trends in the structure of‬
‭the code, especially as highlighted in findings‬‭TOB-SCRL-BLOB-5‬‭and‬‭TOB-SCRL-BLOB-6‬‭,‬
‭present an ongoing source of potential problems that are difficult to conclusively rule out.‬


‭We believe it would be beneficial for Scroll to invest time and effort in documentation and‬
‭modularization of the extremely critical outermost interface of the ZkEVM (i.e., components‬
‭such as those reviewed in this engagement that determine which transactions are‬
‭executed rather than how they run). This portion of the ZkEVM is likely to change more‬
‭often in response to interface changes, such as those prompted by EIP-4844, than the core‬
‭execution logic and thus is more likely to be a source of a minor implementation error that‬
‭transforms an informational finding into a serious exploit.‬


‭Scroll has resolved one of the identified issues and stated that it plans to implement fixes‬
‭for the remaining issues in the future.‬

#### ‭Recommendations‬

‭Based on the codebase maturity evaluation and findings identified during the security‬
‭review, Trail of Bits recommends that Scroll take the following steps:‬


‭●‬ **‭Remediate the findings disclosed in this report.‬** ‭These findings should be‬

‭addressed as part of a direct remediation or as part of any refactor that may occur‬
‭when addressing other recommendations.‬


‭●‬ **‭Work to improve modularity and testing.‬** ‭As noted in‬‭TOB-SCRL-BLOB-5‬‭, witness‬

‭generation code and constraint generation code are intertwined, making the code‬
‭harder to audit; these should be broken out into their own functions. Functions with‬
‭hundreds of lines of code should be broken down into smaller functions. All of these‬
‭new functions should have their own tests.‬


**‭●‬** **‭Invest in more robust documentation of the zkEVM interface circuits.‬** ‭The‬

‭security requirements of a zkEVM implementation are extremely strict, and the‬
‭complexity of evaluating such an implementation is extremely high. The potential‬
‭impact of errors when modifying the interface is quite serious (‬‭TOB-SCRL-BLOB-2‬‭).‬
‭Additionally, we found several instances of insufficient documentation‬
‭(‬‭TOB-SCRL-BLOB-6‬‭) that make the processes of auditing‬‭or safely modifying the‬
‭code error-prone.‬

‭The following tables provide the number of findings by severity and category.‬

## ‭Project Goals‬

‭The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of the Scroll circuits‬
‭enabling support for EIP-4844. Specifically, we sought to answer the following‬
‭non-exhaustive list of questions:‬


‭●‬ ‭Are the barycentric evaluation, public input, and transaction circuits sound and‬

‭complete?‬


‭●‬ ‭Is the EIP-4844-based polynomial evaluation logic in the aggregator circuit a sound‬

‭substitute for the previous hash-based logic?‬


‭●‬ ‭Are newly introduced witnesses in the transaction and public input circuits‬

‭appropriately constrained?‬


‭●‬ ‭Is the integration between different circuits implemented soundly?‬


‭●‬ ‭Are all circuit values appropriately constrained whenever they are used?‬

**‭PUBLIC‬**


## ‭Project Coverage‬

‭This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by‬
‭our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:‬


**‭●‬** **‭Aggregation circuit.‬** ‭We manually reviewed the blob‬‭serialization and barycentric‬

‭evaluation circuits and their uses. We checked whether the correct data is extracted,‬
‭whether the correct data is hashed for the challenge, whether the evaluation‬
‭formula is correctly implemented, and whether data is constrained to fit in the‬
‭correct ranges.‬


**‭●‬** **‭Public input circuit.‬** ‭We manually reviewed the public‬‭input circuit to verify‬

‭whether the public input hashes are correctly computed according to the new‬
‭changes introduced by the blob-carrying transaction support. We checked whether‬
‭the essential equality constraints between sections of the PI table are enforced, as‬
‭well as whether appropriate lookups in the transaction circuits are performed.‬


**‭●‬** **‭Transaction circuit.‬** ‭We manually reviewed the transaction‬‭circuit to verify whether‬

‭the relevant transaction values, such as the hashes of chunks, are properly‬
‭computed. We paid special attention to newly introduced witness values, such as‬
`‭is_chunk_bytes‬` ‭. We also checked whether (often conditional)‬‭constraints on‬
‭these are sufficient.‬

#### ‭Coverage Limitations‬

‭Because of the time-boxed nature of testing work, it is common to encounter coverage‬
‭limitations. The following list outlines the coverage limitations of the engagement and‬
‭indicates system elements that may warrant further review:‬


**‭●‬** **‭Conditional constraints.‬** ‭Due to the complexity of‬‭the conditional logic, especially‬

‭for constraints such as those highlighted in‬‭TOB-SCRL-BLOB-6‬‭,‬‭we were unable to‬
‭conclusively establish that all conditional constraints within the scope sufficiently‬
‭constrain the corresponding values in all cases. While we have no specific reason to‬
‭believe that the constraints are insufficient, we strongly recommend carefully‬
‭reviewing and documenting all conditional constraints to ensure that circuit values‬
‭are used only when the conditions that constrain them are active.‬


**‭●‬** **‭EIP-4844 handling outside the circuit.‬** ‭The aggregation‬‭circuit checks that the‬

‭challenge-evaluation pair provided to it correctly matches the chunk being proven.‬
‭However, it is critical for the validation logic outside the circuit to check that these‬
‭points actually correspond to an evaluation of a committed polynomial (i.e., the L1‬
‭contract must check a KZG opening proof). We did not review the L1 smart contract,‬
‭and we strongly recommend specifically reviewing those changes.‬

## ‭Automated Testing‬

‭Trail of Bits uses automated techniques to extensively test the security properties of‬
‭software. We use both open-source static analysis and fuzzing utilities, along with tools‬
‭developed in house, to perform automated testing of source code and compiled software.‬

#### ‭Test Harness Configuration‬

‭We used the following tools in the automated testing phase of this project:‬


**‭Tool‬** **‭Description‬** **‭Policy‬**


[‭Dylint‬](https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint) ‭A tool for running Rust lints from dynamic libraries‬ ‭Appendix D‬



`[‭cargo-audit‬](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-audit)` ‭An open-source tool for checking dependencies against‬
‭the RustSec advisory database‬


‭Clippy‬ ‭An open-source Rust linter used to catch common‬
‭mistakes and unidiomatic Rust code‬

#### ‭Areas of Focus‬

‭Our automated testing and verification focused on the following:‬



‭Appendix D‬


‭Appendix D‬



‭●‬ ‭Identification of general code quality issues and unidiomatic code patterns‬


‭●‬ ‭Security vulnerabilities in dependencies‬

#### ‭Test Results‬

‭The results of this focused testing are detailed below.‬


**‭Clippy and Dylint.‬** ‭Running Clippy and Dylint did not‬‭raise any notable warnings. However,‬
‭several functions in the repository were large enough to trigger the work limits on some‬
‭lints. We recommend that the Scroll team refactor especially large functions into smaller‬
‭pieces, both for readability and for compatibility with static analysis tools.‬


**`‭cargo-audit‬`** **‭.‬** ‭Running‬ `‭cargo-audit‬` ‭on the codebase uncovered‬‭two dependencies with‬
‭known vulnerabilities. We recommend that the Scroll team investigate and upgrade the‬
‭dependencies shown in the table below.‬

## ‭Codebase Maturity Evaluation‬

‭Trail of Bits uses a traffic-light protocol to provide each client with a clear understanding of‬
‭the areas in which its codebase is mature, immature, or underdeveloped. Deficiencies‬
‭identified here often stem from root causes within the software development life cycle that‬
‭should be addressed through standardization measures (e.g., the use of common libraries,‬
‭functions, or frameworks) or training and awareness programs.‬


**‭Category‬** **‭Summary‬** **‭Result‬**



‭Arithmetic‬ ‭Arithmetic is generally correct. As noted in‬
‭TOB-SCRL-BLOB-7‬‭, some field arithmetic edge-case‬
‭handling is not explicitly handled. There are also several‬
‭places where optimizations rely heavily on specific‬
‭properties of committed values (‬‭TOB-SCRL-BLOB-1‬‭) and‬
‭where the generation of challenge points uses a biased‬
‭reduction method (‬‭TOB-SCRL-BLOB-3‬‭).‬



‭Complexity‬
‭Management‬


‭Cryptography‬
‭and Key‬
‭Management‬



‭The code is organized into modules based on‬
‭functionality. Some functions are several hundred lines‬
‭long, inhibiting maintainability. As noted in‬
‭TOB-SCRL-BLOB-5‬‭, interwoven witness generation code‬
‭and constraint generation code hinder auditing and‬
‭testing.‬


‭The one high-severity finding,‬‭TOB-SCRL-BLOB-2‬‭, stems‬
‭from a missed input in the Fiat-Shamir challenge‬
‭generation. In addition, the challenge generation is‬
‭nonuniform. Although this lack of uniformity is not‬
‭exploitable, it should be addressed as a matter of good‬
‭practice.‬



‭Documentation‬ ‭While inline comments are present in the system and the‬
‭overall architecture is documented, we found several‬
‭places in the codebase where constraints are generated‬
‭under conditions that are unclear and not well‬
‭documented (‬‭TOB-SCRL-BLOB-6‬‭).‬

‭Testing and‬
‭Verification‬



‭High-level functionality tests are present. However,‬
‭several functions cannot have useful unit tests due to‬
‭their excessive length. Additionally, the assignment and‬
‭configuration mixing highlighted in‬‭TOB-SCRL-BLOB-5‬
‭makes certain negative tests difficult to implement.‬

‭Description‬
‭The‬ `‭BarycentricEvaluationConfig‬` ‭circuit constrains‬‭the‬‭𝑦‬‭and‬‭𝑧‬‭values of a polynomial‬
‭evaluation, each represented as vectors of byte-valued cells, so that‬‭𝑦‬‭equals the result of‬
‭evaluating a polynomial interpolated through several blob value field elements at‬‭𝑧‬‭. The‬
‭blob values are constrained to correspond to 32-cell little-endian representation, as shown‬
‭in figure 1.1.‬

```
 ‭// assign LE-bytes of blob scalar field element.‬
 ‭let‬‭blob_i_le‬‭=‬‭self‬‭.scalar.range().gate.assign_witnesses(‬

‭The values in the‬ `‭blob_i_le‬` ‭array are not constrained‬‭to be values in the range [0, 256),‬
‭so this circuit is always satisfiable, even if the value of the‬ `‭blob_i_crt‬` ‭variable is above‬
‭the intended 31-byte limit.‬


‭However, since the‬ `‭BarycentricEvaluationConfig‬` ‭circuit‬‭is used only in conjunction‬
‭with the‬ `‭BlobDataConfig‬` ‭circuit, the values are in‬‭fact constrained to the 31-byte limit.‬
‭These values become the first‬ `‭BLOB_WIDTH‬` ‭entries in‬‭the‬ `‭barycentric_assignments‬`
‭array. Each integer in that portion of the‬ `‭barycentric_assignments‬` ‭array is then‬
‭constrained to equal the integer in the corresponding position in the‬ `‭blob_fields‬` ‭array.‬
‭The values in the‬ `‭blob_fields‬` ‭array are represented‬‭as 31-limb base-256 numbers, while‬
‭the values in the‬ `‭barycentric_assignments‬` ‭array are‬‭represented as 3-limb, base-2‬ <sup>‭88‬</sup>

‭numbers, as shown in figure 1.2.‬

‭Unlike the similar constraints in‬ `‭BarycentricEvaluationConfig‬` ‭, the cells in‬
`‭blob_fields‬` ‭are constrained to be in the range [0,‬‭256), so the limbs are in fact byte‬
‭values. This happens because they are retrieved from the‬ `‭byte‬` ‭column, which is‬
‭constrained by a lookup to be in that range, as shown in figures 1.3 and 1.4.‬

‭2. Public statement not included in the challenge preimage‬


‭Severity:‬ **‭High‬** ‭Difficulty:‬ **‭High‬**


‭Type: Cryptography‬ ‭Finding ID: TOB-SCRL-BLOB-2‬


‭Target:‬ `‭aggregator/src/blob.rs‬`


‭Description‬
‭After the EIP-4844 update, the collection of L2 transactions within a chunk is no longer‬
‭represented directly by a hash. Instead, data in the chunk is serialized and a polynomial is‬
‭derived from that serialized form. That polynomial is provided in a blob on an L1‬
‭transaction, which is accessible to the smart contract via a hash of its KZG polynomial‬
‭commitment. To ensure that the correct transactions are used in the ZkEVM execution‬
‭proof, the smart contract and circuit each check the result of evaluating the polynomial at a‬
‭random challenge point. If the result matches, the system treats that as evidence that the‬
‭transactions being used in the proving step are the same ones chosen in the earlier‬
`‭commit‬` ‭phase.‬


‭The random challenge point is generated via a Fiat-Shamir transform that includes all the‬
‭chunk data that goes into the polynomial commitment. With a strong Fiat-Shamir‬
‭transform, this random evaluation test is sufficient to conclude that the commitment binds‬
‭the prover to a single underlying polynomial: given two polynomials‬‭𝑝‬(‭𝑋‬) ‭and‬‭𝑞‬(‭𝑋‬) ‭of‬
‭degree at most‬‭𝑑‬‭over a field‬‭𝐹‬‭, the chance that‬‭𝑝‬(‭𝑧‬)‭ ‬ = ‭ ‬‭𝑞‬(‭𝑧‬) ‭for a random point‬‭𝑧‬‭is at most‬

<u>‭𝑑‬</u> ~~‭.~~ ‬
‭𝐹‬


‭However, the challenge generation in Scroll’s ZkEVM circuit does not include the KZG‬
‭commitment in its transcript, so the system uses the weak Fiat-Shamir transform. In this‬
‭situation, an adversary who has control over the sequencer can choose a collection of‬
‭chunks,‬ ‭; calculate their corresponding‬‭challenge points and evaluation results,‬
‭𝐶‬‭1‬, ‭𝐶‬‭2‬,..., ‭𝐶‬‭𝑛‬

‭; and‬‭publish a blob corresponding to the polynomial interpolating‬
(‭𝑧‬‭1‬, ‭𝑦‬‭1‬), (‭𝑧‬‭2‬, ‭𝑦‬‭2‬),..., (‭𝑧‬‭𝑛‬, ‭𝑦‬‭𝑛‬)

‭through those points, instead of putting the correct chunk data in the blob. Then the‬
‭prover can arbitrarily choose to generate a proof for any of those chunks.‬


‭If the Scroll ZkEVM is deployed in a setting where a given batch can be finalized only once‬
‭(e.g., if Scroll’s ZkEVM is exclusively an L2 chain on top of Ethereum), then the impact is‬
‭limited to maximum extractable value (MEV)–style attacks on the on-chain contracts. A‬
‭malicious sequencer could generate a malicious blob, wait for other parties to submit‬
‭transactions based on one particular chunk, and then adaptively choose which chunk to‬
‭finalize in order to manipulate the behavior of those later transactions.‬

**‭PUBLIC‬**


‭However, the threat is more severe in a setting where the ZkEVM is deployed as a‬
‭cross-chain bridge.‬


‭Exploit Scenario‬
‭The EIP-4844-enabled ZkEVM is used to create a cross-chain bridge between chain A and‬
‭chain B, relying on blob commitments. Chad controls a malicious sequencer and gets both‬
‭sides of the bridge to commit to a maliciously generated blob corresponding to two‬
‭different chunks. Chad then submits a proof to each chain, finalizing a different chunk on‬
‭each side of the bridge. The state of the bridge diverges, causing a loss of funds.‬


‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, add the blob versioned hash to the challenge generation preimage.‬


‭Long term, always evaluate new uses of cryptographic primitives to ensure that they‬
‭preserve expected properties—in this case, that the commitment is binding. When‬
‭implementing the Fiat-Shamir transform, ensure that random challenge generation‬
‭includes all data relevant to the statement being proven.‬

‭Type: Cryptography‬ ‭Finding ID: TOB-SCRL-BLOB-3‬


‭Target:‬ `‭aggregator/src/blob.rs‬`


‭Description‬
‭Challenge points are generated by taking the Keccak hash of the challenge preimage,‬
‭treating it as a 256-bit integer, and then reducing it modulo the‬ `‭BLS_MODULUS‬` ‭constant,‬
‭which is a 255-bit value. This introduces a (small) bias toward smaller values, so the‬
‭distribution of challenges is nonuniform.‬


‭Ideally, challenges should always be selected uniformly at random from the space of‬
‭possible challenges. In this case, the modulo bias is relatively small, and the entire space of‬
‭values that is biased is sufficiently large that it should not cause a problem. However,‬
‭deviations from a properly uniform random distribution should be avoided or at least‬
‭documented whenever they appear.‬

‭Description‬
‭The‬ `‭assign_data_bytes‬` ‭function takes an‬ `‭offset‬` ‭parameter‬‭that marks the location‬
‭where the prover assigns values of the‬ `‭data_bytes‬` ‭witness. While the offset is used to‬
‭initialize the Random Linear Combination (RLC) accumulator, the initial offset value is‬
‭ignored in some of the subsequent assignments.‬


‭The RLC accumulator is initialized with a call to the‬ `‭assign_rlc_init‬` ‭function. This code‬
‭writes fixed constants in the PI table at the given offset. However, figure 4.1 shows that‬
‭subsequent assignments of the‬ `‭q_block_context‬` ‭and‬ `‭q_tx_hashes‬` ‭columns ignore the‬
‭initial offset.‬

```

`‭q_block_context_start_offset‬` ‭and‬ `‭public_‬` ‭data.‬ `‭q_block_context_end_offset‬`
‭functions) are compatible with the initial offset set to 0. However, any change to the‬

‭offsets. Furthermore, potential issues may become tedious to debug due to incompatible‬
‭offset values.‬

‭Description‬
‭The codebase implementing support for EIP-4844 contains several instances where‬
‭constraints are defined in functions primarily responsible for witness assignment.‬
‭Furthermore, in some cases, the witness generation code is divided into several functions.‬
‭Accordingly, the code generating the constraints is sometimes spread across the codebase.‬
‭This lack of modularity makes the codebase harder to audit.‬


‭For example, the PI circuit must constrain the‬ `‭chunk_txbytes_hash_rlc‬` ‭witness‬
‭assigned in the second section of the PI table to be equal to the‬ `‭chunk_txbytes_hash‬`
‭value assigned in the third section of the PI table. This constraint is buried in the middle of‬
‭the‬ `‭assign_pi_bytes‬` ‭function.‬

```
 ‭let‬‭chunk_txbytes_hash_cell‬‭=‬‭cells[RPI_CELL_IDX].clone();‬
 ‭let‬‭pi_bytes_rlc‬‭=‬‭cells[RPI_RLC_ACC_CELL_IDX].clone();‬

 ‭// Copy chunk_txbytes_hash value from the previous section.‬

   ‭chunk_txbytes_hash_rlc_cell.cell(),‬
 ‭)?;‬

 ‭// Assign row for validating lookup to check:‬
 ‭// pi_hash == keccak256(rlc(pi_bytes))‬

‭Description‬
‭In several cases, constraints are fairly complex, use several optimizations for efficiency, and‬
‭span several functions. The constraints implemented and the rationale for their design are‬
‭often only partially documented. As a consequence of the lack of documentation, manual‬
‭review for the soundness of circuits is a highly error-prone process.‬


‭One such case is the transaction circuit that uses the‬ `‭is_chunk_bytes‬` ‭variable to mark‬
[‭rows that contain transaction data included in a chunk. The‬‭provided documentation‬‭states‬](https://scrollzkp.notion.site/4844-Circuit-Specifications-WIP-00bc5d9fcc244bd9a52bc59ac1523b04)
‭the following:‬

```
   ‭is_chunk_bytes‬

```

_‭●‬_ _‭A transaction’s bytes will be included in chunk bytes iff the transaction is not‬_

_‭padding (identified by a‬_ _`‭0x0‬`_ _‭caller address) and is‬‭not L1 message.‬_


_‭●‬_ _‭The column is constrained to be boolean.‬_


‭However, likely for efficiency reasons,‬ `‭is_chunk_bytes‬` ‭is constrained only when certain‬
‭conditions hold. The gate shown in figure 6.1 implements the constraint in the transaction‬
‭circuit. The gate is activated only when the condition in the highlighted section evaluates to‬
`‭true‬` ‭.‬

```

‭The quoted documentation makes no mention of the condition involved in the constraints,‬
‭supposedly leaving open the possibility of an unconstrained witness when the conditions‬
‭do not hold. However, upon careful inspection of the different uses of‬ `‭is_chunk_bytes‬` ‭, it‬
‭appears those conditional constraints are enforced wherever they matter, and thus, they‬
‭effectively enforce the desired behavior.‬


‭Missing or unclear documentation also affects other circuits in the scope of the review. For‬
‭example, the‬ `‭accumulator‬` ‭column of the‬ `‭BlobDataConfig‬` ‭circuit is documented the‬
‭following way:‬


_‭●‬_ _‭accumulator: Advice column that serves multiple purposes. For the “metadata” section, it‬_

_‭accumulates the big-endian bytes of numValidChunks or chunk[i].chunkSize. For the‬_
_‭“chunk data” section, it increments the value by 1 until we encounter isBoundary is True,‬_
_‭i.e. the end of that chunk, where the accumulator must hold the chunkSize.‬_


‭This column is used in a variety of documented ways, depending on several conditions.‬
‭However, it is also used in an additional undocumented way in the digest RLC section,‬
‭where a collection of constraints, applied in the‬ `‭assign‬` ‭method, causes the‬ `‭accumulator‬`
‭column to contain values from the chunk-size portion of the metadata section. These‬
‭constraints in turn justify the seemingly redundant lookup in figure 6.2, where it may‬
‭appear at first glance that the columns are simply being looked up in themselves, when in‬
‭fact this lookup is a primary way that various blob data consistency checks are enforced:‬

```
 ‭// lookup chunk data digests in the "digest rlc section" of BlobDataConfig.‬
 ‭meta.lookup_any(‬
   ‭"BlobDataConfig (chunk data digests in BlobDataConfig‬‭\"hash section\")"‬‭,‬

‭Although we did not find exploitable issues caused by these complex constraints during‬
‭this engagement, similar patterns—especially with conditional constraints—have led to‬
‭serious issues in previous engagements. For example, in the SHA-256 and EIP-1559 audit,‬
‭the issues TOB-SCROLLSHA-4 and TOB-SCROLLSHA-6 were caused by witnesses that were‬
‭only conditionally constrained and used in contexts where the conditions did not hold.‬


‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, fully document the constraints of each circuit. Aim to capture both the‬
‭high-level goal of each constraint, as well as the assumptions and optimizations used to‬
‭actually implement each constraint. Doing so will improve the auditability and‬
‭maintainability of the codebase.‬


‭Long term, review all conditional constraints to ensure that conditionally constrained‬
‭witnesses are not used in contexts where conditions do not hold.‬

‭In the context of EIP-4844 support, this circuit is used only with a random challenge point,‬
‭and the chance of hitting a 4,096‬ <sup>‭th‬</sup> ‭root of unity‬‭is negligible. However, if this circuit is‬
‭reused in a context where the evaluation point is not random, this behavior may lead to‬
‭unexpected errors.‬


‭Recommendations‬
‭Short term, specify and document the behavior of the‬ `‭BarycentricEvaluationConfig‬`
‭circuit when the challenge point is a root of unity. A simple modification would be to‬
‭constrain‬ `‭z_to_blob_width_minus_one‬` ‭to be nonzero,‬‭which would cause the‬
`‭BarycentricEvaluationConfig‬` ‭circuit to be unsatisfiable‬‭on roots of unity.‬


‭Long term, document or rule out edge-case behavior, especially when that behavior affects‬
‭the context within which the component can be safely used.‬

## ‭C. Code Quality Issues‬

‭●‬ **‭Use of‬** **`‭zip‬`** **‭instead of‬** **`‭zip_eq‬`** ‭. The following code uses‬ `‭zip‬` ‭to perform lookups in‬

‭the keccak table. Although the code performs a length check, using‬ `‭zip_eq‬` ‭is‬
‭recommended. The length check is still needed even with‬ `‭zip_eq‬` ‭.‬

```
      ‭let‬‭keccak_table_exprs‬‭=‬‭keccak_table.table_exprs(meta);‬
       ‭assert_eq!‬‭(input_exprs.len(),‬‭keccak_table_exprs.len());‬

       ‭input_exprs‬
         ‭.into_iter()‬
         ‭.zip(keccak_table_exprs)‬
         ‭.map(|(input,‬‭table)|‬‭(q_keccak.expr()‬‭*‬‭input,‬‭table))‬
         ‭.collect()‬
     ‭});‬
```

‭●‬ **‭Excessive function length‬** ‭. The‬ `‭assign‬` ‭function in‬‭the‬

`‭aggregator/src/aggregation/blob_data.rs‬` ‭file is over‬‭600 lines. This can be‬
‭broken into several smaller functions. Large comment blocks indicate several‬
‭natural sections of the function to break out, such as‬ `‭DIGEST‬‭RLC‬` ‭,‬ `‭LINKING‬` ‭, and‬
`‭DIGEST‬‭BYTES‬` ‭.‬


‭●‬ **‭Commented-out code‬** ‭. The‬ `‭aggregator/src/blob.rs‬` ‭file‬‭contains a‬

‭commented-out section of nearly 150 lines, which contains multiple tests. If these‬
‭tests are needed, they should be uncommented and allowed to run as part of the‬
‭test suite. If they are not needed, they should be removed.‬


‭●‬ **‭Typo in gate label.‬** ‭The inequality should be‬ `‭0‬‭<=‬‭byte‬‭<‬‭256‬` ‭.‬

```
     ‭meta.lookup(‬‭"BlobDataConfig (0 < byte < 256)"‬‭,‬‭|meta|‬‭{‬
```

‭●‬ **‭Potentially unreduced field element.‬** ‭The field element‬‭used for the challenge is‬

‭constrained to have limbs corresponding to a 32-byte value. This value can be‬
‭slightly larger than the BLS scalar modulus. It appears to be used only in contexts‬
‭that correctly handle unreduced field elements, but this should be documented.‬

```
     ‭let‬‭challenge_limb3‬‭=‬‭self‬‭.scalar.range().gate.inner_product(‬
       ‭ctx,‬
       ‭challenge_le[‬‭22‬‭..‬‭32‬‭]‬

## ‭D. Automated Testing‬

‭This section describes the setup of the automated analysis tools used during this audit.‬

#### ‭Clippy‬

[‭The Rust linter‬‭Clippy‬‭can be installed using‬](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) `‭rustup‬` ‭by running the command‬ `‭rustup‬`
`‭component‬‭add‬‭clippy‬` ‭. Invoking the following command‬‭in the root directory of the‬
‭project runs the tool with the pedantic ruleset:‬

```
 ‭cargo clippy --workspace -- -W clippy::pedantic‬
```

_‭Figure D.1: The invocation command used to run Clippy in the codebase‬_


‭Converting the output to the SARIF file format (with, for example,‬ `[‭clippy-sarif‬](https://crates.io/crates/clippy-sarif)` ‭) allows‬
[‭easy inspection of the results within an IDE (e.g., using VSCode’s‬‭SarifViewer‬‭extension).‬](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-SarifVSCode.sarif-viewer)

#### ‭cargo-audit‬

‭The‬ `‭cargo-audit‬` ‭Cargo plugin identifies known vulnerable‬‭dependencies in Rust projects.‬
‭It can be installed using‬ `‭cargo‬‭install‬‭cargo-audit‬` ‭.‬‭To run the tool, run‬ `‭cargo‬‭audit‬`
‭in the crate root directory.‬

#### ‭Dylint‬

[‭Dylint‬‭is a tool for running Rust lints from dynamic‬‭libraries. As with Clippy, the output of‬](https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint)
‭Dylint can be converted to the SARIF file format (with, for example,‬ `[‭clippy-sarif‬](https://crates.io/crates/clippy-sarif)` ‭)‬‭to allow‬
[‭easy inspection of the results within an IDE (e.g., using VSCode’s‬‭SarifViewer‬‭extension):‬](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-SarifVSCode.sarif-viewer)

```
 ‭cargo dylint --all --workspace -- --message-format=json | clippy-sarif‬
```

## ‭E. Fix Review Results‬

‭When undertaking a fix review, Trail of Bits reviews the fixes implemented for issues‬
‭identified in the original report. This work involves a review of specific areas of the source‬
‭code and system configuration, not comprehensive analysis of the system.‬


‭On April 29, 2024, Trail of Bits reviewed the fixes and mitigations implemented by the Scroll‬
‭team for‬‭TOB-SCRL-BLOB-2‬‭, which was identified in this report. We reviewed the fix to‬
‭determine its effectiveness in resolving the associated issue. (Scroll has stated that it plans‬
‭to implement fixes for the remaining issues in the future.)‬


‭In summary, this finding has been resolved. For additional information, please see the‬
‭Detailed Fix Review Results below.‬


**‭ID‬** **‭Title‬** **‭Status‬**


‭2‬ ‭Public statement not included in the challenge preimage‬ **‭Resolved‬**

#### ‭Detailed Fix Review Results‬

**‭TOB-SCROLL-BLOB-2: Public statement not included in the challenge preimage‬**
[‭Resolved in‬‭PR #1211‬‭. Since the changes were merged into the‬](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/1211/) `‭development‬` ‭branch, the‬
‭blob versioned hash is incorporated into the challenge preimage. The blob versioned hash‬
‭is the hash of the KZG commitment, which means that the public statement is now‬
‭incorporated into the Fiat-Shamir transcript, resolving the issue.‬
