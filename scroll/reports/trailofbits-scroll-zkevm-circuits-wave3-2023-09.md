### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

### Engagement Overview

Scroll engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of a set of zkEVM circuits: the proof
compression and aggregation circuit, the updated hash scheme for the Merkle Patricia Trie
(MPT) circuit, the EVM precompile circuits, the zkEVM prover, and the transaction circuit.


A team of two consultants conducted the review from August 14 to September 19, 2023, for
a total of nine engineer-weeks of effort. Our testing efforts focused on the soundness and
completeness of the circuits. With full access to the source code and documentation, we
performed static and dynamic testing of the codebase, using automated and manual
processes.

### Observations and Impact

The security review uncovered one high-severity issue in the `aggregator` crate that allows
a malicious prover to arbitrarily choose the data hash for specially formatted batches
(TOB-SCROLL3-10). The closely related finding TOB-SCROLL3-4 is a “near-miss”
informational finding: although it is not exploitable, any one of several seemingly unrelated
changes would turn it into a critical issue.


We found two low-severity issues: finding TOB-SCROLL3-5 allows an adversary to cause a
denial of service with a specially chosen signing key, and finding TOB-SCROLL3-9 allows an
adversary that can set certain environment variables to corrupt the circuit during the layout
phase.


We also found several cases in which the implementation does not match the specification:
finding TOB-SCROLL3-3 highlights an outdated specification for the MPT circuit, and finding
TOB-SCROLL3-11 highlights an incorrect implementation in which the correct specification
is unclear.

### Recommendations

Based on the codebase maturity evaluation and findings identified during the security
review, Trail of Bits recommends that Scroll take the following steps:


  - **Remediate the findings disclosed in this report.** These findings should be
addressed as part of a direct remediation or as part of any refactor that may occur
when addressing other recommendations.


  - **Develop a more extensive specification for the aggregator and its components.**
The aggregation scheme builds on PSE’s `snark-verifier` library with several
changes made by the Scroll team. The `snark-verifier` library is then used to
compose curve- and field-generic components into a SNARK for a tree of zkEVM

execution proofs. Although several of the protocols used have published security
proofs, the complexity of Scroll’s design warrants careful analysis to ensure that
they are combined in a secure fashion. A more complete specification is critical to
determine whether the `aggregator` crate provides the expected security
guarantees.


In addition, extending the specification may uncover bugs in the implementation.
The only high-severity finding in this report, TOB-SCROLL3-10, is caused by improper
enforcement of constraints that are suggested but not explicitly stated in the
`aggregator` crate’s `README` file. The constraints that are explicitly stated appear to
be correctly implemented.


**●** **Document and test invariants that the code relies on.** During the engagement,
we found several cases in which assumed invariants are not enforced by constraints
or are underconstrained. In most cases, the constraints are implicitly enforced or
protected by other implementation details; for example, finding TOB-SCROLL3-4 is
not exploitable because of a quirk in how `RlcChip::select` is implemented.
However, quirks should not be security critical, and thorough documentation of
invariants and the way they are enforced makes software more robust and easier to
review.


**●** **Add property-based testing.** [Property-based testing libraries such as proptest](https://docs.rs/proptest/latest/proptest/)
generate a large number of random inputs to test specified properties of functions.
The incorrectly implemented function specified in finding TOB-SCROLL3-11 has 14
lines of code that test the function with two different values for its `flags`
parameter; with a similar amount of testing code, a property-based testing
framework would generate hundreds or even thousands of test inputs for each
parameter.


**●** **Specify and standardize circuit configuration methods.** Finding TOB-SCROLL3-9
describes a constant related to the Keccak circuit layout, which is a global constant
in the `aggregator` crate but an environment variable in the Keccak circuit crate that
it relies on. If these different configurations are mismatched, the overall circuit will
be incorrect. Scroll should define and implement a configuration schema that
provides a single source of truth for circuit layout parameters, thereby guaranteeing
that all components agree.

## Project Goals

The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of several components of
Scroll’s zkEVM. Specifically, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list of
questions:


  - Is the updated hashing scheme for the MPT circuit secure? Does it prevent proof
forgeries?


  - Do the aggregation and compression circuits, as specified and implemented,
provide the intended security guarantees? Do they guarantee that a batch proof is
valid only if the batched proofs are valid?


  - Are the APIs of dependencies such as the `halo2-ecc` and `snark-verifier`
libraries used correctly? Are their inputs properly validated? Are any improper
assumptions made about their outputs?


  - Do the precompile circuits correctly implement the expected functionality within the
zkEVM? Are they complete and sound?


  - Does the implementation follow best practices for Rust?

## Project Coverage

This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by
our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:


**●** **The updated MPT circuit:** We manually reviewed the use of the updated hash
scheme to confirm that it provides the necessary domain separation.


  - **The aggregator implementation:** We ran the provided test suite to confirm that it
functions correctly. We manually reviewed the aggregator code in the
`aggregator/src` folder with a focus on the soundness of the aggregation scheme.
We manually reviewed portions of the accumulation and SHPLONK implementations
in the `snark-verifier` and `snark-verifier-sdk` crates to understand their use
in the aggregation and compression circuits.


  - **The ecRecover circuit:** We manually reviewed the subcircuit for soundness issues.
We manually reviewed its use in the zkEVM TxCircuit.

### Coverage Limitations

Because of the time-boxed nature of testing work, it is common to encounter coverage
limitations. The following list outlines the coverage limitations of the engagement and
indicates system elements that may warrant further review:


  - The “P1” EVM precompile circuits:


    - The ecRecover subcircuit was fully reviewed.


    - The ModExp and ecc subcircuits were not reviewed.


    - The zkEVM precompile execution was not reviewed.


  - The “P2” Scroll prover was not reviewed.


  - The “P2” TxCircuit was partially reviewed, with a focus on its interaction with the
ecRecover subcircuit.

## Automated Testing

Trail of Bits uses automated techniques to extensively test the security properties of
software. We use both open-source static analysis and fuzzing utilities, along with tools
developed in house, to perform automated testing of source code and compiled software.

### Test Harness Configuration

We used the following tools in the automated testing phase of this project:


**Tool** **Description** **Policy**



[Semgrep](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep) An open-source static analysis tool for finding bugs and
enforcing code standards when editing or committing code
and during build time



Appendix D.1


```
cargo-llvm
-cov

```


A tool for generating test coverage reports in Rust Appendix D.2



`cargo-edit` A tool for quickly identifying outdated crates Appendix D.3



[Clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/) An open-source Rust linter used to catch common mistakes
and unidiomatic Rust code

### Areas of Focus



Appendix D.4



Our automated testing and verification work focused on identifying the following types of
issues:


  - General code quality issues and unidiomatic code patterns


  - Untested code regions


  - Misuse of APIs


  - Reliance on outdated dependencies

### Test Results

The results of this focused testing are detailed below.


Semgrep
We used custom rules to detect the misuse of APIs and to automate those checks across
the codebase. The rules we used are detailed in appendix D.1.


Trail of Bits 12 Scroll zkEVM Circuits Security Assessment

```
cargo-llvm-cov
```

The coverage report for the MPT circuit indicates an overall similar level of testing coverage
to the report obtained during our previous review of the codebase, and it highlights several
portions of the code that could be tested more thoroughly.


cargo-edit
We ran `cargo-edit` with the command `cargo upgrade --incompatible --dry-run`
and identified three outdated dependencies in the aggregator codebase: `ark-std`,
`ethers-core`, and `itertools` .


Clippy
We ran Clippy in pedantic mode and identified a potentially overflowing integer cast.

## Codebase Maturity Evaluation

Trail of Bits uses a traffic-light protocol to provide each client with a clear understanding of
the areas in which its codebase is mature, immature, or underdeveloped. Deficiencies
identified here often stem from root causes within the software development life cycle that
should be addressed through standardization measures (e.g., the use of common libraries,
functions, or frameworks) or training and awareness programs.


**Category** **Summary** **Result**



Arithmetic We did not identify any serious arithmetic issues in the
codebase. As described in finding TOB-SCROLL3-6, we
found an underconstrained limb decomposition that
does not appear exploitable.



Complexity
Management


Cryptography
and Key
Management



The code is generally well structured and modular.


The aggregator implementation composes complex
generic circuits from the `snark-verifier` and
`snark-verifier-sdk` crates in subtle ways, all of which
must be perfectly correct to ensure security.


We found one high-severity issue, TOB-SCROLL3-10,
which we attribute partly to insufficient complexity
management.


The Sig circuit implementation rejects certain valid
signatures (TOB-SCROLL3-5). The resulting completeness
issue may lead to a denial of service for purposefully
crafted signatures.


The aggregation algorithm is based on recent
cryptographic research in accumulation schemes; it uses
such schemes to implement a non-uniform, nested proof
aggregation protocol. This design is not explicitly
specified, and to our knowledge, such protocols have not
been widely scrutinized. This presents a potentially
[serious risk; for example, vulnerabilities have been found](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/969)
[in an implementation of the Nova accumulation-based](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/969)
[IVC system, which were not present in the proof system](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/969)
itself and arose from efficiency-motivated tweaks to the
original schemes.

Documentation The MPT and aggregator circuits have associated
specifications describing their functionality and
implementations at a high level. The core
implementations are also well commented.


However, the full verification algorithm for the
aggregator circuit is not clearly specified
(TOB-SCROLL3-7).



**Moderate**



Memory Safety
and Error
Handling


Testing and
Verification



The zkEVM circuits project uses no unsafe Rust code. **Satisfactory**



The circuits we reviewed have reasonable test suites.
However, we found one issue that would have been
caught by property-based testing or more extensive unit
tests (TOB-SCROLL3-11), and we found one issue that
limits the testability of the implementation
(TOB-SCROLL3-8).


Many aspects of the aggregator implementation are
specified in its `README` file, but we recommend extending
that specification to include more extensive algorithm
descriptions, security properties, and potentially proof
sketches, as described in finding TOB-SCROLL3-7. Flaws
in this implementation can be quite catastrophic, as
illustrated in the attacks described in finding
TOB-SCROLL3-10.

## Detailed Findings

1. Aggregated public input hash does not include coinbase or difficulty


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL3-1


Target: `aggregator/src/chunk.rs`


Description
The public input hash of an aggregated proof represents the public inputs of all SNARKs
that the proof aggregates. In the case of zkEVM chunks, the public inputs include
commitments to the overall EVM states before and after the chunk and the data included in
the blocks of the chunk, as illustrated by the `ChunkHash` struct, shown in figure 1.1.

```
 pub struct ChunkHash {
   /// Chain identifier
   pub chain_id: u64,
   /// state root before this chunk
   pub prev_state_root: H256,
   /// state root after this chunk
   pub post_state_root: H256,
   /// the withdraw root after this chunk
   pub withdraw_root: H256,
   /// the data hash of this chunk
   pub data_hash: H256,
   /// if the chunk is a padded chunk
   pub is_padding: bool,
 }
```

_Figure 1.1:_ _`[aggregator/src/chunk.rs#18–31](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e40ab9e8e78fd362c50fcd0277db79a1c9a98e60/aggregator/src/chunk.rs#L18-L31)`_


The data hash does not include all fields of the `BlockContext` struct, as shown in figure
1.2. Some fields in `BlockContext`, shown in figure 1.3, are included in the public input
hash through other mechanisms; for example, `chain_id` is used directly to calculate
`chunk_pi_hash` . However, the `coinbase` and `difficulty` fields are not included.

```

   .chain(b_ctx.timestamp.as_u64().to_be_bytes())

 }
```

The `zkevm-circuits` [specification draft describes these fields as constants, so they do not](https://hackmd.io/@dieGzUCgSGmRZFQ7SDxXCA/SJgnAL7qo#)
need to be included individually in each chunk’s hash, but they should be committed to
through some mechanism.


Recommendations
Short term, add `coinbase` and `difficulty` to the aggregated public input hash.


Long term, develop a specification for how all chain constants such as `chain_id`,
`coinbase`, and `difficulty` should be treated when committing to them in the system.

2. Use of account_hash_traces cells does not match specification


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL3-2


Target: `mpt-circuits/src/types.rs`, `mpt-circuits/spec/mpt-proof.md`


Description
The `old_account_hash_traces` and `new_account_hash_traces` arrays each contain
triples of cells corresponding to input and output values of the Poseidon hash function.
These arrays are populated by the `account_hash_traces` function, a portion of which is
shown in figure 2.1.

```
 let mut account_hash_traces = [[Fr::zero(); 3]; 6];
 account_hash_traces[0] = [codehash_hi, codehash_lo, h1];
 account_hash_traces[1] = [storage_root, h1, h2];
 account_hash_traces[2] = [nonce_and_codesize, balance, h3];
 account_hash_traces[3] = [h3, h2, h4]; //
 account_hash_traces[4] = [h4, poseidon_codehash, account_hash];
 account_hash_traces[5] = [
   account_key,
   account_hash,
   domain_hash(account_key, account_hash, HashDomain::Leaf),
 ];
 account_hash_traces
```

_Figure 2.1:_ _`[src/types.rs#512–523](https://github.com/scroll-tech/mpt-circuit/blob/2163a9c436ed85363c954ecf7e6e1044a1b991dc/src/types.rs#L512-L523)`_


This assignment does not match the specification in the `mpt-proof.md` specification,
shown in figure 2.2.

```
 - `old_account_hash_traces`: Vector with item in `[[Fr; 3]; 6]`. For non-empty
 account
   - `[codehash_hi, codehash_lo, h1=hash(codehash_hi, codehash_lo)]`
   - `[h1, storage_root, h2=hash(h1, storage_root)]`
   - `[nonce, balance, h3=hash(nonce, balance)]`
   - `[h3, h2, h4=hash(h3, h2)]`
   - `[1, account_key, h5=hash(1, account_key)]`
   - `[h4, h5, h6=hash(h4, h5)]`
```

_Figure 2.2:_ _`[spec/mpt-proof.md#131–137](https://github.com/scroll-tech/mpt-circuit/blob/2163a9c436ed85363c954ecf7e6e1044a1b991dc/spec/mpt-proof.md?plain=1#L131-L137)`_


It appears that the version implemented in `account_hash_traces` matches the use in the
rest of the circuit. For example, the snippet shown in figure 2.3 uses the expression
`old_account_hash_traces[1][0]` to retrieve the value `old_storage_root` .

However, this pattern of referring to values in the `account_hash_traces` arrays by their
indices is error-prone and difficult to check completely.

3. hash_traces skips invalid leaf hashes


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**

Description
The `hash_traces` function takes a collection of `Proof` objects and returns an array of the
Poseidon hash calls included in those objects, in a format suitable for lookups into the
Poseidon table. For hashes in account leaf nodes, the correct domain is chosen by trial and
error, as shown in figure 3.1.

If the hash does not match any domain, no entry is added to the returned list.


This function is publicly exposed, and if it is used for certain purposes, such as generating
the lookups in a circuit, it could lead to an underconstrained hash witness.


`hash_traces` appears to be used only in a testing context, so it does not currently cause
any security concerns.

should and should not be used.

4. Values in chunk_is_valid_cells are not constrained to be Boolean


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL3-4


Target: `aggregator/src/core.rs`


Description
The cells in the `chunk_is_valid_cells` vector indicate whether a chunk is real or
padded. A padded chunk is simply a copy of the last real chunk. For each chunk, some
checks are performed depending on whether it is valid.


Currently, the `chunk_is_valid_cells` values are not constrained to be Boolean. When
used in conditional equality checks, the lack of Boolean enforcement does not pose a
problem because the constraint required for the conditional equality forces either the
conditioning value to be `0` or the difference of the values under comparison to be `0` .
However, `chunk_is_valid_cells` is also used to compute the number of valid cells in a
batch. The `num_valid_snarks` function, shown in figure 4.1, takes the `chunk_are_valid`
argument, which is called with the `chunk_is_valid_cells` value.

```
 fn num_valid_snarks(
   rlc_config: &RlcConfig,
   region: &mut Region<Fr>,
   chunk_are_valid: &[AssignedCell<Fr, Fr>],
   offset: &mut usize,
 ) -> Result<AssignedCell<Fr, Fr>, halo2_proofs::plonk::Error> {
   let mut res = chunk_are_valid[0].clone();
   for e in chunk_are_valid.iter().skip(1) {
     res = rlc_config.add(region, &res, e, offset)?;
   }
   Ok(res)
 }
```

_Figure 4.1:_ _`[aggregator/src/core.rs#935–946](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e40ab9e8e78fd362c50fcd0277db79a1c9a98e60/aggregator/src/core.rs#L935-L946)`_


In practice, the impact of non-Boolean values in `chunk_is_valid_cells` is limited
exclusively to the very first chunk. Any non-Boolean chunk other than the first one must
satisfy two almost contradictory conditions.


First, it must be continuous with the previous chunk; that is, its previous root must be equal
to the previous chunk’s next root, as shown in figure 4.2:


Trail of Bits 24 Scroll zkEVM Circuits Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


```
// 4 __valid__ chunks are continuous: they are linked via the state roots
for i in 0..MAX_AGG_SNARKS - 1 {

```

```
  for j in 0..DIGEST_LEN {
…

```

```
rlc_config.conditional_enforce_equal(

```

```
       &mut region,
       &chunk_pi_hash_preimages[i + 1][PREV_STATE_ROOT_INDEX + j],
       &chunk_pi_hash_preimages[i][POST_STATE_ROOT_INDEX + j],
       &chunk_is_valid_cells[i + 1],
       &mut offset,
     )?;
  }
}

```


_Figure 4.2:_ _`[aggregator/src/core.rs#666–690](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e40ab9e8e78fd362c50fcd0277db79a1c9a98e60/aggregator/src/core.rs#L666-L690)`_


Second, it must have equal public inputs to the previous chunk, as shown in figure 4.3:

```
 // 6. chunk[i]'s chunk_pi_hash_rlc_cells == chunk[i-1].chunk_pi_hash_rlc_cells when
 // chunk[i] is padded
 let chunks_are_padding = chunk_is_valid_cells
   .iter()
   .map(|chunk_is_valid| rlc_config.not(&mut region, chunk_is_valid, &mut offset))
   .collect::<Result<Vec<_>, halo2_proofs::plonk::Error>>()?;

 let chunk_pi_hash_rlc_cells = parse_pi_hash_rlc_cells(data_rlc_cells);

 for i in 1..MAX_AGG_SNARKS {
   rlc_config.conditional_enforce_equal(
     &mut region,
     chunk_pi_hash_rlc_cells[i - 1],
     chunk_pi_hash_rlc_cells[i],
     &chunks_are_padding[i],
     &mut offset,
   )?;
 }
```

_Figure 4.3:_ _`[aggregator/src/core.rs#692–709](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e40ab9e8e78fd362c50fcd0277db79a1c9a98e60/aggregator/src/core.rs#L692-L709)`_


This requires the previous and next roots to be equal, which may be possible in non-zkEVM
uses but which should not be possible in a zkEVM.


However, these constraints do not prevent a non-Boolean value for
`chunk_is_valid_cells[0]`, so a malicious prover might hope to choose a value for it
that enables an exploit. Suppose a batch of nine chunks is being aggregated; in that
situation, the prover might hope to generate a proof with the initial and final state roots of
`chunks[0..9]` but with the batch hash of `chunks[0..8]`, by setting the value of
`chunk_is_valid_cells[0` ] to `-1` .


Several other checks must be passed to generate such a proof.


Trail of Bits 25 Scroll zkEVM Circuits Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


First, the batch hash must be the hash corresponding to `chunks[0..8]` . In this case, the
flags `(flag1,flag2,flag3)` are `(0,1,0)`, so the chunk data hash will correspond to the
second `potential_batch_data_hash_digest` value, as shown in figure 4.4:


```
let rhs = rlc_config.mul(

```

```
  &mut region,
  &flag1,
  &potential_batch_data_hash_digest[(3 - i) * 8 + j],

  &potential_batch_data_hash_digest[(3 - i) * 8 + j + 64],

Second, the Keccak input length must equal `8`, according to the constraints shown in figure
4.5:

```
 let data_hash_inputs_len =
   rlc_config.mul(&mut region, &num_valid_snarks, &const32, &mut offset)?;

Third, the RLC of the Keccak data input must match any of the three possible Keccak RLC
values. This constraint seems to prevent any practical use of a non-Boolean value for
`chunk_is_valid_cells[0]` because the implementation of `RlcConfig::select`,
shown in figure 4.6, returns the result of `(1 - cond) * b + cond * a`, which causes values in
different positions of the RLC vector to be mixed together when `cond` equals `-1` .

```
 // if cond = 1 return a, else b
 pub(crate) fn select(
   &self,
   region: &mut Region<Fr>,
   a: &AssignedCell<Fr, Fr>,
   b: &AssignedCell<Fr, Fr>,
   cond: &AssignedCell<Fr, Fr>,
   offset: &mut usize,
 ) -> Result<AssignedCell<Fr, Fr>, Error> {
   // (cond - 1) * b + cond * a
   let cond_not = self.not(region, cond, offset)?;
   let tmp = self.mul(region, a, cond, offset)?;
   self.mul_add(region, b, &cond_not, &tmp, offset)
 }
```

_Figure 4.6: This figure shows_ _`RlcConfig::select`_ _. Note that the comment incorrectly specifies_

_`(cond - 1)`_ _instead of_ _`(1 - cond)`_ _, but either version causes the same “mixing” effect for_

_non-Boolean flags. (_ _`[aggregator/src/aggregation/rlc/gates.rs#296–309](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e40ab9e8e78fd362c50fcd0277db79a1c9a98e60/aggregator/src/aggregation/rlc/gates.rs#L296-L309)`_ _)_


However, care should be taken when modifying the implementation of `rlc_with_flag` ; if
it treats all nonzero values of `cond` the same way, this attack may become possible.

 let u1_u2_not_neg = base_chip.range.gate().not(ctx, Existing(u1_u2_x_eq));

As the comment in the code snippet in figure 5.1 indicates, checking the 𝑥 coordinate for

A specially crafted secret key can be used to trigger this incompleteness vulnerability at will.


This issue was also disclosed in a previous audit of the `halo2-ecc` library for Axiom and

Exploit Scenario
Alice deploys a multisignature bridge contract from another EVM-like blockchain to the
Scroll zkEVM. Bob, who is a signing party, wants to be able to maliciously stall the bridge at
some future point. Bob generates a secret key in such a way that some specific, otherwise
innocuous transaction will fail `ecdsa_verify_no_pubkey_check` when signed with Bob’s
key. At a later point, he submits this transaction, which is accepted on the non-Scroll side

potentially a loss of funds.


Recommendations

6. assigned_y_tmp is not constrained to be 87 bits


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL3-6


Target: `zkevm-circuits/src/sig_circuit.rs`


Description
Given a signature (𝑟, 𝑠, 𝑣), the `ecdsa_verify_no_pubkey_check` function uses the parity
information in 𝑣 and recovers the ephemeral point 𝑅 = (𝑥, 𝑦) corresponding to 𝑟.
Concretely, the circuit returns a value indicating whether the signature is valid and the
value 𝑦.


The Sig circuit then ensures that the recovered 𝑦 value is well formed by enforcing that 𝑣
indeed captures the oddness of 𝑦. This is done by showing that there exists a value 𝑡𝑚𝑝
satisfying the equation where is the first limb of the 𝑦 value that was
𝑣+ 2𝑡𝑚𝑝= 𝑦0, 𝑦0

previously recovered by `ecdsa_verify_no_pubkey_check` . Furthermore, 𝑡𝑚𝑝 must be an
87-bit value to ensure soundness. The code snippet in figure 6.1 shows the last check,
where 𝑡𝑚𝑝 corresponds to the `assigned_y_tmp` variable.

```
 // last step we want to constrain assigned_y_tmp is 87 bits
 ecc_chip
   .field_chip
   .range
   .range_check(ctx, &assigned_y_tmp, 88);

```

Contrary to the comment in figure 6.1, the code constraints `assigned_y_tmp` to be 88 bits
instead of 87 bits.


However, this issue is unlikely to lead to any soundness issue because the extra bit
afforded to malicious provers is not enough to craft an invalid witness that satisfies the
constraints.


Recommendations
Short term, constrain `assigned_y_tmp` to be 87 bits.


Long term, add negative tests to ensure that invariants are not violated.

7. Aggregated proof verification algorithm is unspecified


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Cryptography Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL3-7


Target: `aggregator/`


Description
The zkEVM proof aggregation circuit architecture described in the
`aggregator/README.md` file includes several instances of proof aggregation, in the form
of both direct aggregation of proofs and nested aggregation (i.e., aggregation of
already-aggregated proofs). Based on our understanding of the architecture and the
implementation, the final aggregate proof will consist of a triple (𝑝𝑖_ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ, 𝑎𝑐𝑐, π):


1. 𝑝𝑖_ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ is the hash of the overall public inputs of the aggregated proofs.


2. 𝑎𝑐𝑐 is the aggregated “all-but-the-pairing” proof, which, when verified with a pairing
check, should guarantee that each input proof and all aggregation proofs except the
very last one all pass verification.


3. π is a SHPLONK proof that 𝑝𝑖_ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ and 𝑎𝑐𝑐 are correctly constructed and that,
therefore, checking 𝑎𝑐𝑐 with a pairing in fact verifies the overall tree of proofs.


However, the actual details of how to construct and verify this triple are not clearly
specified, documented, or implemented. There are testing-focused macros in the
`aggregator/src/tests.rs` file that implement proof generation followed immediately
by verification; the different components of the proof are represented by the macros
`layer_0`, `compression_layer_snark`, `compression_layer_evm`, and
`aggregation_layer_snark` . However, there are no distinct implementations of
procedures for the following:


  - Proving and verifying key generation


  - Proof generation using the proving key and a witness


  - Verification using the verification key and a proof


Implementing each of these procedures distinctly, especially the key generation and
verification procedures, is critical for evaluating the soundness of the aggregate proof
system. Even if there are not specific problems in the aggregation or compression circuits,
there may be catastrophic issues if vital checks are unintentionally skipped; for example,


Trail of Bits 32 Scroll zkEVM Circuits Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


for key generation to be correct, the verification keys of inner circuits must be constants in
the outer circuits, and in the verification algorithm, both the aggregated proof and the
outermost aggregation proof must be checked.


Recommendations
Short term, develop, implement, and review a clear specification of the proof aggregation
circuit.


Long term, explicitly document the intended security properties of the zkEVM aggregated
proof, and connect those properties to the specification with security proofs or proof
sketches. For example, a rough sketch for the compression circuit may look like the
following:


<u>Intended security property: Verifying the compression circuit applied to circuit 𝐶</u>
should prove knowledge of a valid “all-but-the-pairing” SHPLONK proof for 𝐶 (and
_specifically_ for 𝐶), which has specific public inputs, potentially has an accumulator
and has several polynomial opening proofs, all of which are aggregated
𝑎𝑐𝑐𝐶,

together into an overall accumulator 𝑎𝑐𝑐. After verifying the compression circuit, a
pairing check on 𝑎𝑐𝑐 should prove that there exists a witness assignment 𝑤 that
satisfies the circuit 𝐶.


<u>Proof sketch: Knowledge of the proof for</u> 𝐶 is guaranteed because the compression
circuit includes a SHPLONK “all-but-the-pairing” verifier, and the verification key for 𝐶
is a constant in the compression circuit, which is written into the transcript during
in-circuit verification. Correct accumulation is guaranteed because the compression
circuit includes an accumulation verifier for polynomial commitment multi-opening
proofs, which checks that the public input 𝑎𝑐𝑐 is a correctly accumulated proof.
Thus, verifying the compression circuit and performing a pairing check on 𝑎𝑐𝑐
proves that there exists a witness assignment 𝑤 that satisfies 𝐶.

These checks prevent developers from writing negative tests; for example, they would
block a test that aggregates an incorrect proof with many correct proofs and then checks
that the result does not pass verification. In addition, pairing calls tend to be expensive to
compute, so these calls may unnecessarily decrease prover performance.


Recommendations
Short term, make these checks conditional, either with a feature flag or a function
parameter; then, write negative tests for aggregation and compression.


Long term, ensure that security-critical features such as aggregation verification can be
tested both positively and negatively.

If this environment variable is incorrect when the verification key is generated, or if it
changes during the layout phase, a potentially incorrect circuit may be generated. However,
this type of change would affect many parts of the code, including the witness generation
implementation, and is unlikely to pass even basic tests. Because of that, we do not
consider this to be a plausible soundness problem.


However, a prover whose environment sets `KECCAK_ROWS` to an incorrect value would
consistently fail to create proofs, causing a potential denial-of-service attack vector.


For example, running the command `KECCAK_ROWS=20 cargo test –release`
`test_aggregation_circuit` in the `aggregator` / folder fails on the assertion shown in
figure 9.4:

```
 assert_eq!(
   columns.len(),
   87,
   "cell manager configuration does not match the hard coded setup"
 );

We did not explore other options for `KECCAK_ROWS` or more sophisticated attack scenarios
such as changing the `KECCAK_ROWS` environment variable during prover execution.


Exploit Scenario
Alice runs a sequencer for the Scroll zkEVM. Bob convinces her to install an MEV optimizer,
which under normal conditions behaves normally. However, the optimizer software sets
`KECCAK_ROWS` to other values whenever Bob wishes, causing Alice to consistently fail to
generate proofs, causing a denial of service.

Recommendations
Short term, change `get_num_rows_per_round` so that it reads `KECCAK_ROWS` only once
(e.g., with `[lazy_static](https://docs.rs/lazy_static/latest/lazy_static/)` ), and add assertions to the `aggregator` codebase to make sure
that `KECCAK_ROWS` equals `DEFAULT_KECCAK_ROWS` .


Long term, document all configuration parameters for the zkEVM circuits and any required

10. Incorrect state transitions can be proven for any chunk by manipulating
padding flags


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL3-10


Target: `aggregator/src/core.rs`


Description
Due to insufficient constraints in the aggregation circuit’s padding logic, a malicious prover
can generate two types of invalid proofs:


1. For any chunk `A`, a malicious prover can prove that the empty batch steps from
`A.prev_root` to `A.next_root` .


2. For any pair of chunks `(A,B)` that is continuous (i.e., `A.next_root` equals
`B.prev_root` ), and any choice of data hash `evil_data_hash`, a malicious prover
can generate an aggregated proof in which `batch_prev_root` equals
`A.prev_root`, `batch_next_root` equals `B.next_root`, and `batch_data_hash`
equals `keccak(evil_data_hash)` .


Attack 1 is problematic but unlikely to occur in practice unless empty batches or
sub-batches are allowed to cause state updates.


Attack 2 is extremely severe because it allows a malicious prover to prove that any
`data_hash` has almost any state transition.


Due to time constraints, we were not able to develop proof-of-concept exploits
demonstrating these two attacks, but we believe that such exploits are possible.


The aggregation circuit takes a sequence of SNARKs and a sequence of “validity
𝑠1,..., 𝑠𝑛
flags”, where each is intended to be a Boolean value indicating whether is a
𝑣1,..., 𝑣𝑛 𝑣𝑖 𝑠𝑖
proof for a valid chunk or a padding chunk. Each must be a correct SNARK, but different
𝑠𝑖
rules are enforced on the public inputs of valid and padding chunks. Valid chunks after the
first one must be continuous with the previous chunk, while padding chunks after the first
one must have exactly equal public inputs to the previous chunk. These checks are shown
in figures 10.1 and 10.2.

The `README` section shown in figure 10.3 suggests that, for some situations in which 𝑘> 1,
the first 𝑘 chunks will be valid and the last 𝑛−𝑘 chunks will be padding; however, this is
not explicitly enforced by the aggregation circuit, and both attacks rely on manipulation of
the validity flags.

The last constraint that must be satisfied for attack 1 to succeed is the RLC calculation,
shown in figure 10.9. In theory, the RLC should be equal to `0`, so the check should succeed
by equaling the RLC of the first row. However, due to finding TOB-SCROLL3-11, the
calculated RLC will equal the first byte of the `batch_data_hash` section, which is a padding
byte equal to 1. This can be resolved by setting the second row of the `batch_data_hash`
section, which is otherwise unused in this situation, to the one-byte sequence `[1]` .

Attack 2 must pass many of the same constraints, and proceeds as follows:


1. Set the batch to `[A,A,A,A,B,B,...,B]` and the validity flags to

`[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,...,0]` (i.e., the first four chunks are padding chunks containing
`A`, the fifth chunk is a valid chunk containing `B`, and the remaining chunks are
padding chunks containing `B` ).


2. Set the first row of the `batch_data_hash` section to `evil_data_hash[0..32]` .
This will satisfy the constraints shown in figures 10.7 and 10.8 and will cause the
batch data hash to equal `keccak(evil_data_hash)`, the result from this row.


3. Set the second row of the `batch_data_hash` section to `B.data_hash[0..32]` to
satisfy the requirements shown in figure 10.5. Set the `final` flag on this row to
avoid interfering with the next step.


Trail of Bits 44 Scroll zkEVM Circuits Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


4. Set the third row of the `batch_data_hash` to
```
   [A.data_hash[0],B.data_hash[0],B.data_hash[1],...,B.data_hash[31]]
```

so that the `data_rlc` value in this row will satisfy the constraints in figure 10.9 by
matching the incorrect calculation of `rlc_cell` due to finding TOB-SCROLL3-11.


We believe that this attack can generalize further, but due to time constraints, we did not
evaluate any other cases.


If finding TOB-SCROLL3-11 is resolved, the attack is still possible: steps 3 and 4 must be
modified so that the third row is all zeros and the `final` flag is not set in the second row.


Exploit Scenario
Alice sends a deposit to the Scroll zkEVM L2 contract, and the L1 message for that deposit
is included in a chunk that is successfully committed but not yet finalized. Bob uses attack 2
to generate a proof for an incorrect state transition and uses that proof to finalize the
chunk that Alice sent. The L1 messages that would be popped by that chunk are removed
from the queue with no effect, and because the chunk has been finalized, it cannot be
reverted, causing Alice’s funds to be trapped in the Scroll L2 contract with no way of
withdrawing them.


Recommendations
Short term, add constraints so that `num_valid_snarks` must be nonzero and
`chunk_is_valid_cells` must not have any valid cells after padding chunks.


Long term, specify, review, and test all security-critical logic such as the aggregation
padding validation as thoroughly as possible. In particular, scrutinize any constraints that
have unusual implementation patterns or could lead to _any_ unconstrained or
underconstrained cells. Although the most important fix involves constraining
`chunk_is_valid_cells` directly, attack 2 of this finding is only as severe as it is because
some otherwise innocuous constraints were more flexible than they strictly needed to be:


  - If `potential_batch_data_hash_preimage` cells (shown in figure 10.5) were
always constrained, even for padding chunks, it would not have been possible to fill
the first row with the data from `evil_data_hash` .


  - If unused `batch_data_hash` rows in the Keccak table were forced to be empty, the
RLC checks could not succeed during this attack; for example, by constraining all
three data length fields in figure 10.7 instead of constraining only one of them, it
would not have been possible to put `A.data_hash` in the second row.


  - If the RLC check in figure 10.9 explicitly selected which row’s RLC should be checked
using the `flag` variables, the first row could not have been filled with
attacker-controlled data.

Target: `aggregator/src/aggregation/rlc/gates.rs`


Description
The `RlcConfig::rlc_with_flag` function combines a vector of field elements and a
vector of flag values with a random challenge. The documentation comment on this
function, shown in figure 11.1, suggests that the flag array should act like a mask on the
vector; that is, entries in the vector with a flag of `0` should be set to `0` :

```
 // Returns challenge^k * inputs[0] * flag[0] + ... + challenge * inputs[k-1] *
 flag[k-1]] +
 // inputs[k]* flag[k]
```

The two test cases for this function, shown in figure 11.2, as well as its use in the
aggregation circuit, suggest an alternate intended functionality where entries with a flag
value equal to `0` are simply removed from the vector before the RLC occurs:

```
 // unit test: rlc with flags
 {
   let zero = config.load_private(&mut region, &Fr::zero(), &mut offset)?;
   let one = config.not(&mut region, &zero, &mut offset)?;

If the flags are supposed to act as a filter, only the handling of `flags[0]` needs to change
(e.g., to the version shown in figure 11.4).

```
 pub(crate) fn rlc_with_flag(
   &self,
   region: &mut Region<Fr>,
   inputs: &[AssignedCell<Fr, Fr>],
   challenge: &AssignedCell<Fr, Fr>,
   flags: &[AssignedCell<Fr, Fr>],
   offset: &mut usize,
 ) -> Result<AssignedCell<Fr, Fr>, Error> {
   assert!(flags.len() == inputs.len());

   let mut acc = self.mul(region, &inputs[0], &flags[0], offset)?;
   for (input, flag) in inputs.iter().zip(flags.iter()).skip(1) {
     let tmp = self.mul_add(region, &acc, challenge, input, offset)?;
     acc = self.select(region, &tmp, &acc, flag, offset)?;
   }
   Ok(acc)
 }
```

_Figure 11.4: A fix for_ _`rlc_with_flag`_ _if the flags should act like filters_


If the behavior is supposed to match the documentation comment, the function should be
rewritten to unconditionally multiply `acc` by `challenge` and to conditionally add `input`, as
shown in figure 11.5.

```

Because this function is used only in the `conditional_constraints` function, the impact
of this issue is minimal, and all potential issues we found would also be fixed by addressing
finding TOB-SCROLL3-10.


Recommendations
Short term, determine the correct behavior of `rlc_with_flag` and update the
implementation to reflect that behavior.


Long term, test critical functions such as `rlc_with_flag` on as broad a set of inputs as
[possible. Consider adding a property-based testing framework such as proptest to test](https://docs.rs/proptest/latest/proptest/)
functions over a broad chunk of the input space using random inputs. The property “for
any vector `v`, `rlc_with_test(v,vec![0;` `v.len()]) == 0` ” would have found this
problem.

12. Accumulator representation assumes fixed-length field limbs

Description
KZG accumulators are pairs of elliptic curve points and must be uniquely serialized when
included in the public inputs when verifying SHPLONK proofs. This serialization is done by
the `flatten_accumulator` function from the `snark-verifier-sdk` crate, as shown in
figures 12.1 and 12.2.

```
 // extract the assigned values for
 // - instances which are the public inputs of each chunk (prefixed with 12
 // instances from previous accumulators)
 // - new accumulator to be verified on chain

   &self.svk,

   &self.snarks_with_padding,
   self.as_proof(),
 );
 …

 // extract the following cells for later constraints
 // - the accumulators
 // - the public inputs from each snark
 accumulator_instances.extend(flatten_accumulator(acc).iter().copied());
 // the snark is not a fresh one, assigned_instances already contains an
 // accumulator so we want to skip the first 12 elements from the public input
 snark_inputs.extend(
   assigned_aggregation_instances
     .iter()
     .flat_map(|instance_column| instance_column.iter().skip(ACC_LEN)),
 );

This function does not check or include the lengths of the `truncation` vectors in this
serialization. This is not an active problem because, to our knowledge, the current finite
field implementations in the `halo2-ecc` library guarantee that `truncation` vectors are
always a fixed size. However, if `halo2-ecc` allows variable-length `truncation` vectors, it
may be possible for two different accumulators to serialize to the same array. This should
be documented as an assumption made about `snark-verifier-sdk` and `halo2-ecc`,
and care should be taken when updating `halo2-ecc` or `snark-verifier-sdk` in case this
behavior changes.


Recommendations
Short term, document this requirement and consider adding assertions to
`flatten_accumulator` .


Long term, document all serialization formats used in the aggregator implementation and
ensure that those formats fulfill any assumptions made about them.

13. PlonkProof::read ignores extra entries in num_challenge


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Testing Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL3-13


Target: `snark-verifier/src/verifier/plonk.rs`


Description
Due to the `PlonkProof::read` function’s use of the `zip()` function shown in figure 13.1,
it is possible for a single proof to be verified using two different `Protocol` values, where
one has extra entries in the `num_challenge` field.

```
 let (witnesses, challenges) = {

```

```
let (witnesses, challenges): (Vec<_>, Vec<_>) = protocol

```

```
.num_witness
.iter()
.zip(protocol.num_challenge.iter())
.map(|(&n, &m)| {

```

```
       (transcript.read_n_ec_points(n).unwrap(),
transcript.squeeze_n_challenges(m))

```

```
})
.unzip();

```

```

     witnesses.into_iter().flatten().collect_vec(),
     challenges.into_iter().flatten().collect_vec(),
   )
 };
```

This does not appear to be exploitable as is, but code calling the `PlonkProof::read`
function should be careful not to rely on `Protocol` values to be unique.


Recommendations
Short term, replace this `zip()` call with `zip_eq()` or document this behavior of
`PlonkProof::read` .


Long term, review all calls to `zip()` to ensure that the calling code behaves correctly on
non-equal-length inputs.

14. MAX_AGG_SNARKS values other than 10 may misbehave


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Configuration Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL3-14


Target: `aggregator/src/constants.rs`


Description
The aggregation circuit takes `n` SNARKs and aggregates them into a batch proof that proves
their correctness. The value `n` is represented in the aggregation circuit by the constant
`MAX_AGG_SNARKS`, which is currently set to `10` .

```
 /// Max number of snarks to be aggregated in a chunk.
 /// If the input size is less than this, dummy snarks
 /// will be padded.
 // TODO: update me(?)
 pub const MAX_AGG_SNARKS: usize = 10;
```

_Figure 14.1:_ _`[aggregator/src/constants.rs#56–60](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e40ab9e8e78fd362c50fcd0277db79a1c9a98e60/aggregator/src/constants.rs#L56-L60)`_


The implementation of the aggregation circuit is strongly coupled with a `MAX_AGG_SNARKS`
value of `10` . For instance, the layout of the `batch_data_hash` portion of the Keccak table
expects to have exactly three rounds of the Keccak permutation. While this logic appears to
work for the values `9`, `10`, `11`, and `12`, it is not obvious whether a value of `8` would cause
problems. Consequently, future updates of `MAX_AGG_SNARKS` may require a non-trivial
amount of the circuit to be rewritten.

```
 // #valid snarks | offset of data hash | flags
 // 1,2,3,4 | 0 | 1, 0, 0
 // 5,6,7,8 | 32 | 0, 1, 0
 // 9,10 | 64 | 0, 0, 1
```

During this assessment, we treated `MAX_AGG_SNARKS` as a constant equal to `10`, and we
did not thoroughly evaluate whether the implementation behaves correctly for values
other than `10` . Care should be taken if `MAX_AGG_SNARKS` needs to be changed for any
reason.


Recommendations
Short term, document the assumptions that each component makes about
`MAX_AGG_SNARKS`, and add assertions to enforce those assumptions during circuit
construction.


Trail of Bits 52 Scroll zkEVM Circuits Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


Long term, evaluate the behavior of the aggregator implementation for values of
`MAX_AGG_SNARKS` other than `10`, and if other values need to be used, consider refactoring

## C. Code Quality Findings

We identified the following code quality issues through manual and automatic code review.


  - **The cast shown in figure C.1 could overflow.** This cast should be replaced with a
checked cast, such as by using `TryInto<u16>` .

```
    let num_txs = (num_l2_txs + num_l1_msgs) as u16;
```

**●** **Consider comparing slices to improve readability.** To compare the chain ID used
by the `chunk_pi_hash_preimage` and `batch_pi_hash_preimages` vectors, slices
of length `CHAIN_ID_LEN` can be used to compare the hashes in a more readable
manner.

```
    // 5 assert hashes use a same chain id
    for (i, chunk_pi_hash_preimage) in chunk_pi_hash_preimages.iter().enumerate()
    {
       for (lhs, rhs) in batch_pi_hash_preimage
         .iter()
         .take(CHAIN_ID_LEN)
         .zip(chunk_pi_hash_preimage.iter().take(CHAIN_ID_LEN))
       {
       [...]
       }
    }
```

**●** **The comment in figure C.3 differs from the implementation.** The code and the
implementation are functionally equivalent due to how padding works.

```
    // 2.2 chunk[k-1].post_state_root
    // sanity check
    assert_equal(
      &batch_pi_hash_preimage[i + POST_STATE_ROOT_INDEX],
      &chunk_pi_hash_preimages[MAX_AGG_SNARKS - 1][i + POST_STATE_ROOT_INDEX],
```

  - **The comment specifying the upper bound of the** **`num_of_valid_snarks`** **value**
**is incorrect.** The upper bound should be `MAX_AGG_SNARKS`, which equals `10` .

```
   // num_of_valid_snarks <= 12, which needs 3 keccak-f rounds. Therefore the batch's
   // data hash (input, len, data_rlc, output_rlc) are in the 3rd 300 keccak rows;
```

`ConstraintBuilder` APIs and the `ExecutionGadget` trait.

```
 semgrep --metrics=off --sarif --config=custom_rule_path.yml
```

_Figure D.1: The invocation command used to run Semgrep for each custom rule_


Duplicate Constraints
The presence of duplicate constraints, with potentially different labels, indicates either a
redundant constraint that can be removed or an intended constraint that was not correctly
updated.

identified in the original report. This work involves a review of specific areas of the source
code and system configuration, not comprehensive analysis of the system.


From September 28 to September 29, 2023, Trail of Bits reviewed the fixes and mitigations
implemented by the Scroll team for the issues identified in this report. We reviewed each
fix to determine its effectiveness in resolving the associated issue.


In summary, of the 14 issues described in this report, Scroll has resolved four issues, has
partially resolved one issue, and has not resolved one issue. No fix PRs were provided for
the remaining eight issues, so their fix statuses are undetermined. For additional
information, please see the Detailed Fix Review Results below.

### Detailed Fix Review Results

**TOB-SCROLL3-1: Aggregated public input hash does not include coinbase or difficulty**
[Partially resolved in PR #824. The](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/824) `coinbase` and `difficulty` fields are still not included in
the public input hash. However, as a sanity check, the verifier code now asserts that the
`coinbase` and `difficulty` values provided as public inputs equal the constants that are
either hard-coded or read from environment variables. We note that when the `coinbase`
and `difficulty` values are read from environment variables, these values are read
repeatedly. This may not enforce that the constants are the same for all blocks if the
verifier’s process is influenced to modify the environment variables at runtime.


**TOB-SCROLL3-2: Use of account_hash_traces cells does not match specification**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-SCROLL3-3: hash_traces skips invalid leaf hashes**
Undetermined _._ No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-SCROLL3-4: Values in chunk_is_valid_cells are not constrained to be Boolean**
[Resolved in PR #902. The implementation now constrains each cell in the](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/902)
`chunk_is_valid_cells` vector to be Boolean. The Boolean constraints are implemented
by calling the `enforce_binary` method of the `rlc_config` object.


**TOB-SCROLL3-5: The Sig circuit may reject valid signatures**
[Unresolved. The changes made in PR #904 do not address the issues, and the circuit still](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/904)
rejects signatures where .
𝑢1𝐺= 𝑢2 𝑄


**TOB-SCROLL3-6: assigned_y_tmp is not constrained to be 87 bits**
[Resolved in PR #904. The circuit now constrains](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/904) `assigned_y_tmp` to be 87 bits by passing
`87` (instead of `88` ) as an argument to the `range_check` method.


**TOB-SCROLL3-7: Aggregated proof verification algorithm is unspecified**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-SCROLL3-8: Aggregation prover verifies each aggregated proof**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-SCROLL3-9: KECCAK_ROWS environment variable may disagree with**
**DEFAULT_KECCAK_ROWS constant**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.

**TOB-SCROLL3-10: Incorrect state transitions can be proven for any chunk by**
**manipulating padding flags**
[Resolved in PR #979. The code has been modified to add the](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/979) `constrain_flags` method,
which constrains `chunk_is_valid_cells` as recommended. Concretely,
`constrain_flags` adds the following constraints: the first element of
`chunk_is_valid_cells` is `1`, all subsequent elements are constrained to be Boolean with
the method `rlc_config.enforce_binary`, and lastly, an element of
`chunk_is_valid_cells` with a value of `1` constrains the previous element to also be `1` .
Furthermore, `constrain_flags` adds all elements in `chunk_is_valid_cells`, and the
return value is assigned to `num_valid_snarks` . Therefore, given the aforementioned
constraints, `num_valid_snarks` is guaranteed to be at least `1` and upper-bounded by
`MAX_AGG_SNARKS` . These changes, therefore, address the issue as recommended.
Nevertheless, we recommend that the Scroll team consider implementing other
defense-in-depth mechanisms suggested in the long-term recommendation.


**TOB-SCROLL3-11: RlcConfig::rlc_with_flag is incorrect**
[Resolved in PR #979. The implementation has been amended to implement a filter-like](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/979)
functionality in which inputs corresponding to flag `0` are first removed from the input
vector before the RLC is performed. We recommend updating the documentation and code
comments to match the implemented functionality.


**TOB-SCROLL3-12: Accumulator representation assumes fixed-length field limbs**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-SCROLL3-13: PlonkProof::read ignores extra entries in num_challenge**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-SCROLL3-14: MAX_AGG_SNARKS values other than 10 may misbehave**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.
