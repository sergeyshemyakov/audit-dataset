## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Scroll engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the changes introduced during phase 2
of the Euclid upgrade. These changes add enforced transactions and enforced batches, as
well as restructuring block information from calldata to blobs, with associated changes to
the zero-knowledge chunk and batch circuits.


A team of three consultants conducted the review from March 6 to March 21, 2025, for a
total of four engineer-weeks of effort. Our testing efforts focused on assessing the
soundness and correctness of the changes made to the chunk and batch circuits, the
soundness of the enforced liveness mechanism, and whether the rollup contract correctly
handles version 7 batches. With full access to source code and documentation, we
performed static and dynamic testing of the codebase, using automated and manual
processes.

#### Observations and Impact

We did not uncover any soundness or completeness issues in the changes made to the
chunk, batch, and bundle circuits. However, we identified one potentially impactful but
difficult-to-exploit supply-chain issue in the use of GitHub actions in the `zkvm-prover`
repository, TOB-SCREUC2-4.
​
We did not uncover any issues in the smart contract logic that would adversely affect the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system. The updates have sufficient data
validation, access controls, and testing to ensure liveness and support the processing of v7
batches.

#### Recommendations

Based on the findings identified during the security review, Trail of Bits recommends that
Scroll take the following steps:


●​ **Remediate the findings disclosed in this report.** These findings should be
addressed as part of a direct remediation or any refactor that may occur when
addressing other recommendations.


●​ **Document updates to any system-level invariants.** The introduction of the
enforced liveness mechanism and updates to the circuits lead to critical changes to
the system’s core invariants (see appendix D). Documenting these updates and
ensuring that they are programmatically tested is essential to validating the system’s
new behavior.


**●​** **Test the reversion of unfinalized v6 batches post-migration.** If the upgrade
<u>completes and a v6 batch must be reverted, the rollup contract must be</u>

downgraded, the v6 batches must be reverted, and the rollup contract needs to be
re-upgraded. This is currently not tested. Alternatively, finalize all v6 batches before
migrating to v7 batches.

## Project Goals

The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of the Scroll phase 2 Euclid
upgrade. Specifically, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list of questions:


●​ Do the changes made to the chunk and batch circuits introduce any soundness or
completeness issues?


●​ Is the KZG point opening verification functionality correctly implemented and used
in the circuit?


●​ Does the new message queue implementation correctly update the rolling hash for
incoming L1 messages?


●​ Does the rollup contract correctly handle v7 batches (encoding, commitment,
finalization, and reversion)?


●​ Can an attacker bypass the enforced liveness mechanism or any access controls?


●​ Does the upgrade include any storage layer changes that could cause issues during
the migration?


●​ Can the deprecated message queue (version 1) be used to cause undefined
behavior?

## Project Coverage

This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by
our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:


**●​** **Zkvm-prover.** We manually reviewed the chunk, batch, and bundle circuits,
focusing on soundness and correctness issues. Specific areas of focus include the v7
payload decoding and validation, the KZG point opening verification routine, and its
use in the context of EIP-4844.


**●​** **Scroll-contracts.** We manually reviewed the new message queue (version 2),
updates to the rollup contract, and any associated contract updates (e.g., the L1
cross-domain messenger). Specific areas of focus include soundness of the rolling
message hash implementation, soundness of the enforced liveness mechanism,
implications of EIP-7702 on address aliasing, and correctness of the encoding,
commitment, finalization, and reversion of v7 batches.

## Automated Testing

Trail of Bits uses automated techniques to extensively test the security properties of
software. We use both open-source static analysis and fuzzing utilities, along with tools
developed in-house, to perform automated testing of source code and compiled software.

#### Test Harness Configuration

We used the following tools in the automated testing phase of this project:


**Tool** **Description** **Policy**



[Clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/) An open-source Rust linter used to catch common
mistakes and unidiomatic Rust code



Appendix C



[Dylint](https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint) A tool for running Rust lints from dynamic libraries Appendix C



`[cargo-audit](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-audit)` An open-source tool for checking dependencies against
the RustSec advisory database



Appendix C



`[cargo-edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit)` A tool for quickly identifying outdated crates Appendix C


[zizmor](https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor) A static analysis tool for GitHub Actions Appendix C

#### Areas of Focus

Our automated testing and verification work focused on the following system properties:


●​ General code quality issues and unidiomatic code patterns


●​ Security of CI and GitHub Actions


●​ Identifying dependencies that are outdated or vulnerable to known attacks

#### Test Results

The results of this focused testing are detailed below.


**cargo-audit**
cargo-audit did not identify any dependency vulnerable to known security issues.


**Clippy**
[Clippy reports warnings for three idiomatic and performance rules: manual assert,](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#manual_assert)
[or_fun_call, and explicit_iter_loop, which we have included in our report for the Euclid](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#or_fun_call)

upgrade phase 1 engagement. We recommend adding these rules to your regular Clippy
runs.


**cargo-edit**
Cargo-edit identified several outdated dependencies, including some that are, in a semantic
versioning sense, compatible with the version currently in use, and others that are not.
[Consider integrating Dependabot to automatically update dependencies as soon as these](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide)
are available.

## Detailed Findings

1. Polynomial evaluation does not consider roots of unity edge case


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCREUC2-1


Target:
```
 zkvm-prover/crates/circuits/batch-circuit/src/blob_consistency/openv
 m.rs

```

Description
The polynomial evaluation does not check whether the evaluation point is one of the roots
of unity. If this were to happen, the prover would panic when trying to invert zero. This is a
highly unlikely scenario given that the evaluation point `z` is currently used only after
[deriving it using a hash function, but the EIP-4844 specification and the reference](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/86fb82b221474cc89387fa6436806507b3849d88/specs/deneb/polynomial-commitments.md#evaluate_polynomial_in_evaluation_form:~:text=%23%20If%20we%20are%20asked%20to%20evaluate%20within%20the%20domain%2C%20we%20already%20know%20the%20answer%0A%20%20%20%20if%20z%20in%20roots_of_unity_brp%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20eval_index%20%3D%20roots_of_unity_brp.index%0x28z%0x29%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20return%20BLSFieldElement%0x28polynomial%5Beval_index%5D%0x29) `c-kzg`
implementation still perform this check.

```
 for (i = 0; i < FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_BLOB; i++) {
   /*
 * If the point to evaluate at is one of the evaluation points by which the
 polynomial is
 * given, we can just return the result directly. Note that special-casing this
 is
 * necessary, as the formula below would divide by zero otherwise.
 */
   if (fr_equal(x, &brp_roots_of_unity[i])) {
     *out = poly[i];
     ret = C_KZG_OK;
     goto out;
   }
   blst_fr_sub(&inverses_in[i], x, &brp_roots_of_unity[i]);
 }
```

Figure 1.2 shows where, if passed a root of unity, the implementation would panic when
trying to invert zero.

```
 fn interpolate(z: &Scalar, coefficients: &[Scalar; BLOB_WIDTH]) -> Scalar {
   let blob_width = u64::try_from(BLOB_WIDTH).unwrap();
   (pow_bytes(z, &blob_width.to_be_bytes()) - <Scalar as IntMod>::ONE)
     * ROOTS_OF_UNITY

```

        .iter()
        .zip_eq(coefficients)
        .map(|(root, f)| f * root * (z.clone() - root).invert())
```

Adding the check both guarantees that the implementation follows the specification and
that if it is changed or reused in a context that allows an attacker to provide the evaluation
point, it will not suffer from completeness issues.


Recommendations
Short term, add the check ensuring that the implementation does not throw a runtime
error if the evaluation point is one of the roots of unity.


Long term, add tests exercising this particular code path.

2. Transaction data length missing from the ChunkInfo PI hash


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Cryptography Finding ID: TOB-SCREUC2-2


Target: `zkvm-prover/crates/circuits/types/src/chunk/public_inputs.rs`


Description
The public input hash function for the `ChunkInfo` structure does not include the
`tx_data_length` . This means that two different `ChunkInfo` structures that differ only in
the `tx_data_length` field would have the same public input hash.

```
 pub struct ChunkInfo {
   /// The EIP-155 chain ID for all txs in the chunk.
   #[rkyv()]
   pub chain_id: u64,
   /// The state root before applying the chunk.
   #[rkyv()]
   pub prev_state_root: B256,
   /// The state root after applying the chunk.
   #[rkyv()]
   pub post_state_root: B256,
   /// The withdrawals root after applying the chunk.
   #[rkyv()]
   pub withdraw_root: B256,
   /// Digest of L2 tx data flattened over all L2 txs in the chunk.

We could not identify a soundness issue resulting from the missing field in the hash
calculation, given that the `tx_data_length` field is used to validate the `tx_data_digest`
field in the `PayloadV7::validate` function.


Recommendations
Short term, add the missing `tx_data_length` field to the `keccak256` call of
`ChunkInfo::pi_hash` .


Long term, consider using a derive macro to implement structured public input hashing.

3. Risky use of GITHUB_ENV in GitHub action


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Data Exposure Finding ID: TOB-SCREUC2-3


Target: `zkvm-prover/.github/workflows/profile-guest.yml`


Description
The `profile-guest` GitHub action uses the `GITHUB_ENV` variable to save the result of a
command and use it in another step within the same job. However, due to the potential
security consequences of using the `GITHUB_ENV` variable, we recommend using the
`GITHUB_OUTPUT` variable instead.


Currently, the `profile-guest` action runs after the `build-guest` action has been
completed and performs the following steps:


1.​ Checks out the default branch in the repository;


2.​ Downloads the cached artifact;


3.​ Runs `make profile-chunk` and gathers how many cycles were used, saving it to
`$GITHUB_ENV` ;


4.​ Updates the pull request with the saved information.

```
 - name: Guest profiling to capture total_cycles
  id: guest-profiling
  run: |
   # Run the tests and capture the output
   output=$(make profile-chunk | grep "scroll-zkvm-integration(chunk-circuit):
 total cycles = ")
   echo "total_cycles=$output" >> $GITHUB_ENV

 - name: Update PR Description
  uses: actions/github-script@v6
  with:
   script: |
    const prNumber = context.payload.pull_request.number;
    const totalCycles = process.env.total_cycles;
    const currentBody = context.payload.pull_request.body;

    // Update the PR description with the total cycles
    const newBody = `### Total Cycles
 (chunk-circuit)\n${totalCycles}\n\n${currentBody}`;
    await github.pulls.update({

```

​

**PUBLIC​** **​** Security Assessment


```
     owner: context.repo.owner,
     repo: context.repo.repo,
     pull_number: prNumber,
     body: newBody,
    });
```

_Figure 3.1:_ _`[.github/workflows/profile-guest.yml#L28-L50](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkvm-prover//blob/c5781b608438b3dedccf468d696d99ecf27a110f/.github/workflows/profile-guest.yml#L28-L50)`_


Currently, the action is not vulnerable because the branch that is checked out is the main
branch and not the pull request branch, and because the value that is written to
`$GITHUB_ENV` can only be a single `u64` . If, instead, the current action added the first line of
`chunk-app-vmexe` to the `GITHUB_ENV`, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the
following step of the job by using the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable.


Recommendations
Short term, prefer `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` to pass values between different job steps. Carefully
review GitHub actions triggered on `workflow_run` .


Long term, add zizmor to the CI/CD pipeline of the codebase.

4. Unpinned external GitHub CI/CD action versions


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Auditing and Logging Finding ID: TOB-SCREUC2-4


Target: `zkvm-prover/.github/workflows/`


Description
Several GitHub Actions workflows in the `zkvm-prover` repository use third-party actions
[pinned to a tag or branch name instead of a full commit SHA as recommended by GitHub.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions)
This configuration enables repository owners to silently modify the actions. A malicious
actor could use this ability to tamper with an application release or leak secrets.


The following actions are owned by organizations or individuals that are not affiliated
directly with Scroll:

Exploit Scenario
An attacker gains unauthorized access to the account of a GitHub action owner. The
attacker manipulates the action’s code to steal GitHub credentials and compromise the
repository.

Recommendations
Short term, pin each third-party action to a specific full-length commit SHA, as
[recommended by GitHub. Additionally, configure Dependabot to update the actions’](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions)
commit SHAs after reviewing their available updates.


Long term, add `[zizmor](https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor)` to the CI/CD pipeline.

5. Potential credential persistence in artifacts


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Configuration Finding ID: TOB-SCREUC2-5


Target: `.github/workflows/{profile-guest.yml, lint.yml`,
```
 build_guest.yml}

```

Description
The default behavior of the `actions/checkout` GitHub action is to persist credentials,
which means that the GitHub token is written to the local repository directory. This allows
the action to execute Git commands that require authentication. The credentials are stored
in `.git/config` files in the local repository directory, where they could be inadvertently
included in workflow artifacts or accessed by subsequent workflow steps.

```
 jobs:
  profile-guest:
   if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' }}
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   steps:
    - name: Checkout code
     uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Download artifact (chunk app.vmexe)
     uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
     with:
       name: chunk-app-vmexe
       path: ./crates/circuits/chunk-circuit/openvm/
```

_Figure 5.1:_ _`[.github/workflows/profile-guest.yml#9–21](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkvm-prover//blob/c5781b608438b3dedccf468d696d99ecf27a110f/.github/workflows/profile-guest.yml#L9-L21)`_


Currently, the actions with the credential persistence do not appear to save them into
artifacts that are publicly available, but we recommend adding this flag to prevent potential
issues in case the actions are updated.


Recommendations
Short term, add `persist-credentials:` `false` to checkout actions that do not require
privileged Git operations.


Long term, add `[zizmor](https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor)` to the CI/CD pipeline.

## B. Code Quality Findings

We identified the following code quality issues through manual and automatic code review.
These issues are not associated with any specific vulnerabilities. However, they will
enhance code readability and may prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities in the future.


**●​** **Blob byte format is not documented in the Rust code.** Although the `Blob` data
format can be inferred from the implementation, we encourage adding
documentation describing the format.

```
    impl From<&[u8]> for EnvelopeV7 {
         fn from(blob_bytes: &[u8]) -> Self {
```

_Figure B.1:_ _`[circuits/types/src/batch/payload/v7.rs#32–33](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkvm-prover//blob/c5781b608438b3dedccf468d696d99ecf27a110f/crates/circuits/types/src/batch/payload/v7.rs#L32-L33)`_


**●​** **Rust codebase includes duplicate and outdated files.** The Rust codebase has the
`circuits/batch-circuit/src/payload` folder, which includes duplicate and
outdated files included in `circuits/types/src/batch/payload` . The `v7.rs` file
included within is outdated and uses the wrong constant for parsing block contexts.

```
     // Deserialize block contexts depending on the number of blocks in the batch.
     let mut block_contexts = Vec::with_capacity(num_blocks as usize);
     for i in 0..num_blocks {
       let start = (i as usize) * SIZE_BLOCK_CTX + INDEX_NUM_BLOCKS;
       block_contexts.push(BlockContextV2::from(
         &payload_bytes[start..(start + SIZE_BLOCK_CTX)],
       ));
     }
```

_Figure B.2:_ _`[circuits/batch-circuit/src/payload/v7.rs#161–168](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkvm-prover//blob/c5781b608438b3dedccf468d696d99ecf27a110f/crates/circuits/batch-circuit/src/payload/v7.rs#L161-L168)`_

```
    // Deserialize block contexts depending on the number of blocks in the batch.
    let mut block_contexts = Vec::with_capacity(num_blocks as usize);
    for i in 0..num_blocks {
       let start = (i as usize) * SIZE_BLOCK_CTX + INDEX_BLOCK_CTX;
       block_contexts.push(BlockContextV2::from(
         &payload_bytes[start..(start + SIZE_BLOCK_CTX)],
       ));
    }
```

_Figure B.3:_ _`[crates/circuits/types/src/batch/payload/v7.rs#161–168](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkvm-prover//blob/c5781b608438b3dedccf468d696d99ecf27a110f/crates/circuits/types/src/batch/payload/v7.rs#L161-L168)`_


**●​** **The previous state root is redundantly fetched twice.** The `pre_state_root` and
`prev_state_root` variables are assigned the same value, and the implementation
could use just one of them.

```
     let pre_state_root = witness.blocks[0].pre_state_root;

```

​
Trail of Bits​ 25​ Scroll Euclid Upgrade Phase 2​
**PUBLIC​** **​** Security Assessment


```
     let chain = Chain::from_id(witness.blocks[0].chain_id());

     // enable all forks
     let hardforks = (*SCROLL_DEV_HARDFORKS).clone();

     let inner = ChainSpec {
       chain,
       genesis_hash: Default::default(),
       genesis: Default::default(),
       genesis_header: Default::default(),
       paris_block_and_final_difficulty: Default::default(),
       hardforks,

     };
     let config = ScrollChainConfig::mainnet();
     let chain_spec = ScrollChainSpec { inner, config };

     let (code_db, nodes_provider, block_hashes) =
     make_providers(&witness.blocks);
     let nodes_provider = manually_drop_on_zkvm!(nodes_provider);

     let prev_state_root = witness.blocks[0].pre_state_root();
```

_Figure B.4:_ _`[circuits/types/src/chunk/execute.rs#43–68](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkvm-prover//blob/c5781b608438b3dedccf468d696d99ecf27a110f/crates/circuits/types/src/chunk/execute.rs#L43-L68)`_


**●​** **Unresolved TODO comment in the code base.** The code comment mentions that
the binary patching function should be removed once OpenVM reaches v1.0, which
has already happened. Consider tracking such items on a centralized issue tracker
like GitHub issues.

```
     /// TODO: remove this after openvm v1.0
     fn binary_patch(elf_bin: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
```

_Figure B.5:_ _`[build-guest/src/builder/mod.rs#49–50](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkvm-prover//blob/c5781b608438b3dedccf468d696d99ecf27a110f/crates/build-guest/src/builder/mod.rs#L49-L50)`_


**●​** **Multiple conversions when moving from the** **`halo2curves_axiom::bls12_381`**
**type to the** **`openvm_pairing_guest::bls12_381`** **type.** The implementation first
uses the `Bls12_381_G1::from_compressed_be` to deserialize the witness bytes,
then converts this with `G1Affine::from_xy_unchecked`, and finally uses
`G1Affine::from_xy_nonidentity` to check that the points are not the infinity
point. Instead, consider doing the infinity check after the initial deserialization with
the `Bls12_381_G1::is_identity` function; this will ensure that only one
conversion is needed to convert to the OpenVM type.

```
    // Verify KZG proof.
    let proof_ok = {
      let commitment = Bls12_381_G1::from_compressed_be(kzg_commitment)

```

## C. Automated Analysis Tool Confguration i

We used the following tools to perform automated testing of the codebase.


C.1. Clippy

The Rust linter [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) can be installed using `rustup` by running the command `rustup`
`component` `add` `clippy` . Invoking `cargo` `clippy` `--` `-W` `clippy::pedantic` in the root
directory of the project runs the tool with the pedantic ruleset.


Clippy results from the regular set of rules should always be fixed.

```
 # run clippy in regular and pedantic mode and output to SARIF
 cargo clippy --message-format=json | clippy-sarif > clippy.sarif
 cargo clippy --message-format=json -- -W clippy::pedantic -Wclippy::or_fun_call |
 clippy-sarif > clippy_pedantic.sarif
```

_Figure C.1: The invocation commands used to run Clippy in the codebase_


Converting the output to the SARIF file format (e.g., with `[clippy-sarif](https://crates.io/crates/clippy-sarif)` ) allows easy
inspection of the results within an IDE (e.g., using VSCode’s [SARIF Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=trailofbits.sarif-explorer) extension).


C.2. Dylint

[Dylint](https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint) is a tool for running Rust lints from dynamic libraries, similar to Clippy. We ran the
general and supplementary rulesets against the codebase, finding no remarkable issues.

```
 cargo dylint --no-deps --git https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint --pattern
 examples/general -- --message-format=json | clippy-sarif > general.sarif

 cargo dylint --no-deps --git https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint --pattern
 examples/supplementary -- --message-format=json | clippy-sarif > supplementary.sarif
```

_Figure C.2: The command used to run Dylint on the project_


C.3. cargo-edit

`[cargo-edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit)` allows developers to quickly find outdated Rust crates. The tool can be
installed with the `cargo` `install` `cargo-edit` command, and the `cargo` `upgrade`
`--incompatible` `--dry-run` command can be used to find outdated crates.


C.4. cargo-audit

The `[cargo-audit](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-audit)` Cargo plugin identifies known vulnerable dependencies in Rust projects.
It can be installed using `cargo` `install` `cargo-audit` . To run the tool, run `cargo` `audit`
in the crate root directory.

C.5. zizmor

[Zizmor is a static analysis tool for GitHub Actions. It can be installed using](https://woodruffw.github.io/zizmor/) `cargo install`
`--locked zizmor` . We ran zizmor with the following commands:

```
 zizmor . --format sarif > zizmor.sarif
 zizmor --persona pedantic . --format sarif > zizmor_pedantic.sarif
```

## D. Smart Contract Invariants

Below is a non-exhaustive list of invariants that we identified during the course of the audit.
This list specifically pertains to the changes made to the smart contracts for the new
EuclidV2 upgrade.


●​ `firstCrossDomainMessageIndex <= nextUnfinalizedQueueIndex <=`
```
   nextCrossDomainMessageIndex

```

○​ `firstCrossDomainMessageIndex` must not change once it is set.


●​ The `L1MessageQueueV1` contract should no longer be callable.


●​ A user cannot directly append a message to the `L1MessageQueueV2` queue (must
go through the L1 scroll messenger or the enforced transaction gateway).


●​ The enforced liveness mechanism is activated if and only if:


○​ An L1 message has not been finalized for more than
`maxDelayMessageQueue` seconds.


○​ A batch has not been finalized for more than
`maxDelayEnterEnforcedMode` seconds.


●​ A v7 batch header must be 73 bytes long.


●​ All messages in the `L1MessageQueueV1` queue must be finalized before finalizing
any messages in the `L1MessageQueueV2` queue.


●​ All batches that are not v7 must be finalized before finalizing any v7 batches.


●​ Messages in the `L1MessageQueueV2` queue cannot be skipped or dropped.


●​ The system configuration can be updated only by the owner.


●​ The rolling hash mechanism must be deterministic.


●​ All v6 batches must be finalized before the first v7 batch is finalized.


●​ Commitments of v6 and below batches must revert.


●​ No actor can directly enable the enforced liveness mechanism.


●​ The owner can directly disable the enforced liveness mechanism.


●​ No actor cannot directly update the `V1_MESSAGES_FINALIZED_OFFSET` flag.

#### Detailed Fix Review Results

**TOB-SCREUC2-1: Polynomial evaluation does not consider roots of unity edge case**
Unresolved. The Scroll team provided the following context for this finding’s fix status:


_The polynomial evaluation function_ should _in fact handle the case where the challenge_
_could be a root of unity. Given how we have included this function in a standalone_
_module, it comes across as available for a generic use-case. We are missing_
_documentation/dev notes that we have skipped this explicit handling of root of unity case_
_since in our case, the challenge is a keccak digest and the assumption is that the chances_
_of that being a root of unity are negligible. It's worth adding such a note so that it does_
_not get used for a generic purpose in the future._


**TOB-SCREUC2-2: Transaction data length missing from the ChunkInfo PI hash**
Unresolved. The Scroll team provided the following context for this finding’s fix status:


_The tx_data_length is only required as a witness in the batch-circuit. We only need it to_
_compute the tx_data_digest, i.e. the keccak digest of all L2 tx bytes chunk-by-chunk from_
_the blob's payload. It essentially helps us in identifying chunk boundaries in the batch's_
_data. It is essentially not required to be a part of the public-input from the chunk-circuit._
_However, given the way we setup the abstraction in the Circuit and AggCircuit traits, we_
_thought its best to simply include the value tx_data_length in ChunkInfo and pass it on to_
_the next layer (BatchCircuit). Since it’s only an additional witness, we preferred passing it_
_through this type instead of externally passing it through the BatchProvingTask or_
_BatchWitness._


**TOB-SCREUC2-3: Risky use of GITHUB_ENV in GitHub action**
[Resolved in commits f616e and 7b1f7 by using the](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkvm-prover/pull/98/commits/f616e6e9882b384aca04010025521b2689ea1657) `GITHUB_OUTPUT` variable and sanitizing
the template interpolation.


**TOB-SCREUC2-4: Unpinned external GitHub CI/CD action versions**
[Resolved in commit 076b1 by pinning external actions to commit hashes.](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkvm-prover/pull/98/commits/076b10c6544f22fcdd3c44c0719502fcef915c1c)


**TOB-SCREUC2-5: Potential credential persistence in artifacts**
[Resolved in commit 7d18c by disabling the default credential persistence option.](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkvm-prover/pull/98/commits/7d18c7462d6afb16b85c92c3177f26908573bc27)

Trail of Bits considers this report public information; it is licensed to Scroll under the terms
of the project statement of work and has been made public at Scroll’s request. Material

#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

Trail of Bits performed all activities associated with this project in accordance with a
statement of work and an agreed-upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often rely on information provided by a
client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in this report
should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or defects in the
target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test software controls and
security properties. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but each
has its limitations. For example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that violates a
property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. A project's time and
resource constraints also limit their use.
