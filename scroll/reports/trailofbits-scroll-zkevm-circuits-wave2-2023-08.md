#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Scroll engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of a set of zkEVM circuits: the Merkle
Patricia trie (MPT) circuit, the Copy circuit, word-addressable memory optimizations, and
the Super circuit.


A team of three consultants conducted the review from July 17 to August 4, 2023, for a total
of six engineer-weeks of effort. Our testing efforts focused on ensuring that the circuits are
sound, complete, and faithful implementations of the specifications. With full access to the
source code and documentation, we performed static and dynamic testing of the
codebase, using automated and manual processes.

#### Observations and Impact

The security review of the codebase uncovered three high-severity issues related to the
soundness of the circuits: finding TOB-SCROLL2-6 affects the MPT circuit and allows
attackers to bypass checks when creating or updating the MPT node containing the account
nonce and code size; finding TOB-SCROLL2-8 allows attackers to hijack the EVM control
flow after the `CREATE` opcode is called, allowing them to redirect a successful EVM
execution to a halt with an error state; and finding TOB-SCROLL2-9 affects the `OneHot`
primitive and may allow a malicious prover to skip constraints in the MPT update circuit.


We found several inconsistencies between the MPT circuit specification and its
implementation (TOB-SCROLL2-3, TOB-SCROLL2-4, and TOB-SCROLL2-7).


We also found some issues involving unresolved “TODO” comments and stub
implementations used for testing, including the informational finding TOB-SCROLL2-1 and
the high-severity finding TOB-SCROLL2-9.

#### Recommendations

Based on the codebase maturity evaluation and findings identified during the security
review, Trail of Bits recommends that Scroll take the following steps:


  - **Remediate the findings disclosed in this report.** These findings should be
addressed as part of a direct remediation or as part of any refactor that may occur
when addressing other recommendations.


  - **Revise the circuit specifications.** During the engagement, we found several
inconsistencies between the specifications and the circuit implementations. The
documentation also lacks high-level descriptions of how the circuits work.
Higher-level descriptions would greatly aid developers and auditors in quickly
understanding the inner workings of the circuits and allow them to more easily

**PUBLIC**


identify potential structural flaws. After the specifications are revised and clarified,
ensure that the circuit implementations are faithful to the updated specifications.


  - **Implement branch/leaf domain separation in the Merkle tree design.** The
Merkle tree design implemented in the MPT circuit does not correctly include
domain separation between branch and leaf nodes, which could enable Merkle
proof forgery. We did not include this flaw as a finding in this report because we
found it during our separate audit of the `zktrie` library, but the fix will need to be
implemented in both `zktrie` and the MPT circuit.


**●** **Address the “TODO” comments in the code and test with non-stub**
**implementations.** Although they are useful for rapid development and testing,
“TODO” comments and testing with stub implementations allow flaws to remain in
the codebase. Each “TODO” should be tracked and triaged in a centralized issue
tracker (e.g., GitHub issues), not in code comments, and should be fixed if needed;
each mock implementation should be associated with a full implementation that can
be used in occasional full test suite runs.


  - **Consider refactoring the MPT update verification code to separate Merkle**
**path–checking logic from proof-specific logic.** The current circuit simultaneously
checks Merkle paths and checks various proof-specific attributes of the leaves. This
design makes the circuit fairly complex, with two simultaneous state machines
modeled within the table and many repeated checks, which we believe has
contributed to copy-paste problems such as finding TOB-SCROLL2-6. Separating the
Merkle path checks from the specific checks used for specific update types would
improve modularity and may make any future required modifications easier to do.


The following tables provide the number of findings by severity and category.

## Project Goals

The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of a subset of Scroll’s zkEVM
circuits. Specifically, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list of questions:


  - Does the codebase follow best practices for Rust?


  - Are the circuits sound and complete?


  - Are the MPT circuit and word-addressable memory optimization Rust
implementations faithful to their specifications?


  - Are the MPT path–checking state machines correctly designed and implemented?
Are the correct transitions enforced? Is it possible to skip required checks by
manipulating the state machines?


  - Are the word-addressable optimizations sound? Has the associated code refactoring
introduced any vulnerabilities into the codebase?

## Project Coverage

This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by
our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:


**●** **The MPT circuit:** We manually reviewed the circuit utilities and the update-checking
circuit in `mpt_update.rs` . If we identified vulnerable code patterns or code smells,
we used Semgrep to perform variant analysis and to search for other instances of
the same patterns. We compared the implementation with the specification and
reported the identified differences.


**●** **The Copy circuit and word-addressable memory optimizations:** We reviewed the
memory optimization specification for soundness and manually reviewed the Copy
circuit and associated gadgets against the Copy circuit specification document.
Additionally, we reviewed the refactoring that needed to be done on several zkEVM
circuits due to the introduced optimizations.


**●** **The Super circuit:** We manually reviewed the circuit for incorrect circuit
initialization issues.

## Automated Testing

Trail of Bits uses automated techniques to extensively test the security properties of
software. We use both open-source static analysis and fuzzing utilities, along with tools
developed in house, to perform automated testing of source code and compiled software.

#### Test Harness Configuration

We used the following tools in the automated testing phase of this project:


**Tool** **Description** **Policy**



[Semgrep](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep) An open-source static analysis tool for finding bugs and
enforcing code standards when editing or committing code
and during build time



Appendix D.1


```
cargo-llvm
-cov

```


A tool for generating test coverage reports in Rust Appendix D.2



`cargo-edit` A tool for quickly identifying outdated crates Appendix D.3



[Clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/) An open-source Rust linter used to catch common mistakes
and unidiomatic Rust code

#### Areas of Focus



Appendix D.4



Our automated testing and verification work focused on identifying the following:


  - General code quality issues and unidiomatic code patterns


  - Untested code regions with coverage reports


  - Variants of manually found vulnerable API patterns

#### Test Results

The results of this focused testing are detailed below.


Clippy

**MPT circuit:** Running Clippy in pedantic mode on the MPT circuit reveals several code
quality issues and unidiomatic code patterns, including the following:
`semicolon_if_nothing_returned`, `match_same_arms`, `needless_pass_by_value`,


Trail of Bits 10 Scroll zkEVM Circuits Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


`inconsistent_struct_constructor`, `return_self_not_must_use`, and
`map_unwrap_or` .


We recommend routinely (e.g., every minor release) running Clippy in pedantic mode. If
certain patterns are commonly found, consider adding these rules to the default CI Clippy
runs.


Semgrep

The rules that we wrote to find variants of manually found vulnerable API patterns are
provided in appendix D.


cargo-edit

Running `cargo-edit` with `cargo upgrade --incompatible --dry-run` finds five
outdated crates used by the MPT circuit codebase: `ethers-core`, `itertools`, `strum`,
`strum_macros`, and `rand_chacha` .


cargo-llvm-cov

The coverage report for the MPT circuit indicates several coverage limitations.

## Codebase Maturity Evaluation

Trail of Bits uses a traffic-light protocol to provide each client with a clear understanding of
the areas in which its codebase is mature, immature, or underdeveloped. Deficiencies
identified here often stem from root causes within the software development life cycle that
should be addressed through standardization measures (e.g., the use of common libraries,
functions, or frameworks) or training and awareness programs.


**Category** **Summary** **Result**



Arithmetic We found no issues related to the use of integer
arithmetic in the codebase.



Complexity
Management


Cryptography
and Key
Management



The general structure of the implementation is well
organized and separated into clear modules.


However, the state machine–based design of the MPT
circuit is fairly complex, and the Merkle path verification
code is tightly coupled with the code that validates the
data stored within a given leaf. Two state machines
govern Merkle path checking, each of whose state
transitions are different depending on the proof type.
Each proof type also has some repetitive but slightly
changed constraints, such as the constraints enforcing
the exact path through an account leaf.


The MPT design implemented in this circuit is vulnerable
to proof forgery attacks, as disclosed in a previous audit
of the `zktrie` library. The implementation will need to
be updated so that it has a secure design before it is
suitable for deployment.

Documentation Both the MPT and the Copy circuit, as well as the
word-addressable memory optimizations, have
associated specification documents. However, we found
several discrepancies between the specifications and
implementations. We recommend that the specifications
be revised and extended with high-level descriptions of
the logic behind each circuit. Having the revised
specifications will allow developers to have a clearer
understanding of the circuits.

The zkEVM circuits project uses no unsafe Rust code. **Satisfactory**



We identified some test-coverage limitations in the MPT
circuit codebase by using the `cargo-llvm-cov` tool.
Several of the findings that we identified in this review
could have been detected with a comprehensive positive
and negative test suite.


Because we found high-severity findings related to circuit
soundness, we believe it is necessary to develop an
adversarial testing process, especially focused on
malicious prover behavior. Formal methods to check for
(e.g., circuit determinacy) should also be investigated and
considered.

## Detailed Findings

1. PoseidonLookup is not implemented


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Testing Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL2-1


Target: `src/gadgets/poseidon.rs`


Description
Poseidon hashing is performed within the MPT circuit by performing lookups into a
Poseidon table via the `PoseidonLookup` trait, shown in figure 1.1.

```
 /// Lookup represent the poseidon table in zkevm circuit
 pub trait PoseidonLookup {
   fn lookup_columns(&self) -> (FixedColumn, [AdviceColumn; 5]) {
     let (fixed, adv) = self.lookup_columns_generic();
     (FixedColumn(fixed), adv.map(AdviceColumn))
   }
   fn lookup_columns_generic(&self) -> (Column<Fixed>, [Column<Advice>; 5]) {
     let (fixed, adv) = self.lookup_columns();
     (fixed.0, adv.map(|col| col.0))
   }
 }
```

_Figure 1.1:_ _`[src/gadgets/poseidon.rs#11–21](https://github.com/scroll-tech/mpt-circuit/blob/7b56d0b323e92ac11e54213520f6e7db41941cd0/src/gadgets/poseidon.rs#L11-L21)`_


This trait is not implemented by any types except the testing-only `PoseidonTable` shown
in figure 1.2, which does not constrain its columns at all.

```
 #[cfg(test)]
 #[derive(Clone, Copy)]
 pub struct PoseidonTable {
   q_enable: FixedColumn,
   left: AdviceColumn,
   right: AdviceColumn,
   hash: AdviceColumn,
   control: AdviceColumn,
   head_mark: AdviceColumn,
 }

 #[cfg(test)]
 impl PoseidonTable {
   pub fn configure<F: FieldExt>(cs: &mut ConstraintSystem<F>) -> Self {

```

Trail of Bits 15 Scroll zkEVM Circuits Security Assessment

```
     let [hash, left, right, control, head_mark] =
        [0; 5].map(|_| AdviceColumn(cs.advice_column()));
     Self {
        left,
        right,
        hash,
        control,
        head_mark,
        q_enable: FixedColumn(cs.fixed_column()),
     }
   }
```

_Figure 1.2:_ _`[src/gadgets/poseidon.rs#56–80](https://github.com/scroll-tech/mpt-circuit/blob/7b56d0b323e92ac11e54213520f6e7db41941cd0/src/gadgets/poseidon.rs#L56-L80)`_


The rest of the codebase treats this trait as a black-box implementation, so this does not
seem to cause correctness problems elsewhere. However, it does limit one’s ability to test
some negative cases, and it makes the test coverage rely on the correctness of the
`PoseidonTable` struct’s witness generation.


Recommendations
Short term, create a concrete implementation of the `PoseidonLookup` trait to enable full
testing of the MPT circuit.


Long term, ensure that all parts of the MPT circuit are tested with both positive and
negative tests.

2. IsZeroGadget does not constrain the inverse witness when the value is zero


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Cryptography Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL2-2


Target: `src/gadgets/is_zero.rs`


Description
The `IsZeroGadget` implementation allows for an arbitrary `inverse_or_zero` witness
value when the `value` parameter is `0` .


The gadget returns `1` when `value` is `0` ; otherwise, it returns `0` . The implementation relies
on the existence of an inverse for when `value` is nonzero and on correctly constraining
that `value * (1 - value * inverse_or_zero) == 0` .


However, when `value` is `0`, the constraint is immediately satisfied, regardless of the value
of the `inverse_or_zero` witness. This allows an arbitrary value to be provided for that
witness value.

```
 pub fn configure<F: FieldExt>(
   cs: &mut ConstraintSystem<F>,
   cb: &mut ConstraintBuilder<F>,
   value: AdviceColumn, // TODO: make this a query once Query is
 clonable/copyable.....
 ) -> Self {

```

```
let inverse_or_zero = AdviceColumn(cs.advice_column());
cb.assert_zero(

```

```
     "value is 0 or inverse_or_zero is inverse of value",
     value.current() * (Query::one() - value.current() *
inverse_or_zero.current()),

```

```
);
Self {

```

```
     value,
     inverse_or_zero,
   }
 }
```

Recommendations
Short term, ensure that the circuit is deterministic by constraining `inverse_or_zero` to
equal `0` when `value` is `0` .

3. The MPT nonexistence proof gadget is missing constraints specified in the
documentation


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Cryptography Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL2-3


Target: `src/gadgets/mpt_update/nonexistence_proof.rs`


Description
The gadget for checking the consistency of nonexistence proofs is missing several
constraints related to type 2 nonexistence proofs.


The circuit specification includes constraints for the nonexistence of path proofs that are
not included in the implementation. This causes the witness values to be unconstrained in
[some cases. For example, the following constraints are specified:](https://github.com/scroll-tech/mpt-circuit/blob/7b56d0b323e92ac11e54213520f6e7db41941cd0/spec/mpt-proof.md?plain=1#L167-L174)


  - `other_key_hash` should equal `0` when `key` does not equal `other_key` .


  - `other_leaf_data_hash` should equal the hash of the empty node (pointer by
`other_key` ).


Neither of these constraints is enforced in the implementation: this is because the
implementation has no explicit constraints imposed for the type 2 nonexistence proofs.
Figure 3.1 shows that the circuit constrains these values only for type 1 proofs.

```
 pub fn configure<F: FieldExt>(
   cb: &mut ConstraintBuilder<F>,
   value: SecondPhaseAdviceColumn,
   key: AdviceColumn,
   other_key: AdviceColumn,
   key_equals_other_key: IsZeroGadget,
   hash: AdviceColumn,
   hash_is_zero: IsZeroGadget,
   other_key_hash: AdviceColumn,
   other_leaf_data_hash: AdviceColumn,
   poseidon: &impl PoseidonLookup,
 ) {
   cb.assert_zero("value is 0 for empty node", value.current());
   cb.assert_equal(
     "key_minus_other_key = key - other key",
     key_equals_other_key.value.current(),
     key.current() - other_key.current(),
   );
   cb.assert_equal(

```

```
     "hash_is_zero input == hash",
     hash_is_zero.value.current(),
     hash.current(),
   );

   let is_type_1 = !key_equals_other_key.current();
   let is_type_2 = hash_is_zero.current();
   cb.assert_equal(
     "Empty account is either type 1 xor type 2",
     Query::one(),
     Query::from(is_type_1.clone()) + Query::from(is_type_2),
   );

   cb.condition(is_type_1, |cb| {
     cb.poseidon_lookup(
        "other_key_hash == h(1, other_key)",
        [Query::one(), other_key.current(), other_key_hash.current()],
        poseidon,
     );
     cb.poseidon_lookup(
        "hash == h(key_hash, other_leaf_data_hash)",
        [
          other_key_hash.current(),
          other_leaf_data_hash.current(),
          hash.current(),
        ],
        poseidon,
     );
   });
```

The Scroll team has stated that this is a specification error and that the missing constraints
do not impact the soundness of the circuit.


Recommendations
Short term, update the specification to remove the description of these constraints; ensure
that the documentation is kept updated.


Long term, add positive and negative tests for both types of nonexistence proofs.

Description
The MPT circuit implementation is not faithful to the circuit specification in many areas and
does not contain comments for the constraints that are either missing from the
implementation or that diverge from those in the specification.


The allowed segment transitions depend on the proof type. For the `NonceChanged` proof
type, the specification states that the `Start` segment type can transition to `Start` and that
the `AccountLeaf0` segment type also can transition to `Start` . However, neither of these
paths is allowed in the implementation.


```
MPTProofType::NonceChanged
| MPTProofType::BalanceChanged
| MPTProofType::CodeSizeExists
| MPTProofType::CodeHashExists => [

```

```
(

```

```
SegmentType::Start,

```

```
     SegmentType::AccountTrie, // mpt has > 1 account
     SegmentType::AccountLeaf0, // mpt has <= 1 account
  ],
),

```

```
SegmentType::AccountTrie,
vec![

```

```
     SegmentType::AccountTrie,
     SegmentType::AccountLeaf0,
     SegmentType::Start, // empty account proof
  ],
),

(SegmentType::AccountLeaf1, vec![SegmentType::AccountLeaf2]),
(SegmentType::AccountLeaf2, vec![SegmentType::AccountLeaf3]),
(SegmentType::AccountLeaf3, vec![SegmentType::Start]),

The transitions allowed for the `PoseidonCodeHashExists` proof type also do not match:
the specification states that it has the same transitions as the `NonceChanged` proof type,
but the implementation has different transitions.


The key depth direction checks also do not match the specification. The specification states
that the `depth` parameter should be used but the implementation uses `depth - 1` .

```
 cb.condition(is_trie.clone(), |cb| {

```

```

Finally, the specification states that when a segment type is a non-trie type, the value of
`key` should be constrained to `0`, but this constraint is omitted from the implementation.

```
 cb.condition(!is_trie, |cb| {
   cb.assert_zero("depth is 0 in non-trie segments", depth.current());

5. Redundant lookups in the Word RLC circuit


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Cryptography Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL2-5


Target: `src/gadgets/mpt_update/word_rlc.rs`


Description
The Word RLC circuit has two redundant lookups into the `BytesLookup` table.


The Word RLC circuit combines the random linear combination (RLC) for the lower and
upper 16 bytes of a word into a single RLC value. For this, it checks that the lower and
upper word segments are 16 bytes by looking into the `BytesLookup` table, and it checks
that their RLCs are correctly computed by looking into the `RlcLookup` table. However, the
lookup into the `RlcLookup` table will also ensure that the lower and upper segments of the
word have the correct 16 bytes, making the first two lookups redundant.


```
pub fn configure<F: FieldExt>(

```

```
  cb: &mut ConstraintBuilder<F>,
  [word_hash, high, low]: [AdviceColumn; 3],
  [rlc_word, rlc_high, rlc_low]: [SecondPhaseAdviceColumn; 3],
  poseidon: &impl PoseidonLookup,
  bytes: &impl BytesLookup,
  rlc: &impl RlcLookup,
  randomness: Query<F>,
) {

```

```
cb.add_lookup(

```

```
  " old_high is 16 bytes",
  [high.current(), Query::from(15)],
  bytes.lookup(),
);
cb.add_lookup(

```

```
   " old_low is 16 bytes",
   [low.current(), Query::from(15)],
   bytes.lookup(),
 );
 cb.poseidon_lookup(
   "word_hash = poseidon(high, low)",
   [high.current(), low.current(), word_hash.current()],
   poseidon,
 );

 cb.add_lookup(
   "rlc_high = rlc(high) and high is 16 bytes",
   [high.current(), Query::from(15), rlc_high.current()],

```

   cb.add_lookup(

     [low.current(), Query::from(15), rlc_low.current()],
     rlc.lookup(),
```

_Figure 5.1:_ _`[mpt-circuit/src/gadgets/mpt_update/word_rlc.rs#16–49](https://github.com/scroll-tech/mpt-circuit/blob/7b56d0b323e92ac11e54213520f6e7db41941cd0/src/gadgets/mpt_update/word_rlc.rs#L16-L49)`_


Although the `WordRLC::configure` function receives two different lookup objects, `bytes`
and `rlc`, they are instantiated with the same concrete lookup:

```
 let mpt_update = MptUpdateConfig::configure(
   cs,
   &mut cb,
   poseidon,
   &key_bit,
   &byte_representation,
   &byte_representation,
   &rlc_randomness,
   &canonical_representation,
 );
```

We also note that the labels refer to the upper and lower bytes as `old_high` and `old_low`
instead of just `high` and `low` .


Recommendations
Short term, determine whether both the `BytesLookup` and `RlcLookup` tables are needed
for this circuit, and refactor the circuit accordingly, removing the redundant constraints.


Long term, review the codebase for duplicated or redundant constraints using manual and
automated methods.

6. The NonceChanged configuration circuit does not constrain the new value
nonce value


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Cryptography Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL2-6


Target: `src/gadgets/mpt_update.rs`


Description
The `NonceChanged` configuration circuit does not constrain the `config.new_value`
parameter to be 8 bytes. Instead, there is a duplicated constraint for `config.old_value` :

```
 SegmentType::AccountLeaf3 => {
   cb.assert_zero("direction is 0", config.direction.current());

```

```
let old_code_size = (config.old_hash.current() - config.old_value.current())
  * Query::Constant(F::from(1 << 32).square().invert().unwrap());
let new_code_size = (config.new_hash.current() - config.new_value.current())

```

```
  * Query::Constant(F::from(1 << 32).square().invert().unwrap());
cb.condition(

```

```
config.path_type.current_matches(&[PathType::Common]),
|cb| {

```

```
cb.add_lookup(
  "old nonce is 8 bytes",
  [config.old_value.current(), Query::from(7)],
  bytes.lookup(),
);
cb.add_lookup(
  "new nonce is 8 bytes",
  [config.old_value.current(), Query::from(7)],
  bytes.lookup(),
);

```

This means that a malicious prover could update the `Account` node with a value of
arbitrary length for the `Nonce` and `Codesize` parameters.


The same constraint (with a correct label but incorrect value) is used in the `ExtensionNew`
path type:


```
cb.condition(

```

```
config.path_type.current_matches(&[PathType::ExtensionNew]),
|cb| {

```

```
cb.add_lookup(

```

```

Exploit Scenario
A malicious prover uses the `NonceChanged` proof to update the nonce with a larger than
expected value.


Recommendations
Short term, enforce the constraint for the `config.new_value` witness.


Long term, add positive and negative testing of the edge cases present in the specification.
For both the `Common` and `ExtensionNew` path types, there should be a negative test that
fails because it changes the new nonce to a value larger than 8 bytes. Use automated
testing tools like Semgrep to find redundant and duplicate constraints, as these could
indicate that a constraint is incorrect.

7. The Copy circuit does not totally enforce the tag values


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Cryptography Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL2-7


Target: `src/copy_circuit/copy_gadgets.rs`


Description
The Copy table includes a tag column that indicates the type of data for that particular row.
However, the Copy circuit tag validation function does not totally ensure that the tag
matches one of the predefined tag values.


The implementation uses the `copy_gadgets::constrain_tag` function to bind the
`is_precompiled`, `is_tx_calldata`, `is_bytecode`, `is_memory`, and `is_tx_log`
witnesses to the actual tag value. However, the code does not ensure that exactly one of
these Boolean values is `true` .

In fact, the tag value could equal `CopyDataType::RlcAcc`, as in the `SHA3` gadget. The
`CopyDataType::Padding` value is also not currently matched.


In the current state of the codebase, this issue does not appear to cause any soundness
issues because the lookups into the Copy table either use a statically set source and
destination tag or, as in the case of precompiles, the value is correctly bounded and does
not pose an avenue of attack for a malicious prover.


We also observe that the Copy circuit specification mentions a witness value for the
`is_rlc_acc` case, but this is not reflected in the code.


Recommendations
Short term, ensure that the tag column is fully constrained. Review the circuit specification
and match the implementation with the specification, documenting possible optimizations
that remove constraints and detailing why they do not cause soundness issues.

8. The “invalid creation” error handling circuit is unconstrained


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Cryptography Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL2-8


Target: `evm_circuit/execution/error_invalid_creation_code.rs`


Description
The “invalid creation” error handling circuit does not constrain the first byte of the actual
memory to be `0xef` as intended. This allows a malicious prover to redirect the EVM
execution to a halt after the `CREATE` opcode is called, regardless of the memory value.


The `ErrorInvalidCreationCodeGadget` circuit was updated to accommodate the
memory addressing optimizations. However, in doing so, the `first_byte` witness value
that was bound to the memory’s first byte is no longer bound to it. Therefore, a malicious
prover can always satisfy the circuit constraints, even if they are not in an error state after
the `CREATE` opcode is called.

```
 fn configure(cb: &mut EVMConstraintBuilder<F>) -> Self {
   let opcode = cb.query_cell();

   let first_byte = cb.query_cell();

   //let address = cb.query_word_rlc();

   let offset = cb.query_word_rlc();
   let length = cb.query_word_rlc();
   let value_left = cb.query_word_rlc();

   cb.stack_pop(offset.expr());
   cb.stack_pop(length.expr());
   cb.require_true("is_create is true", cb.curr.state.is_create.expr());

   let address_word = MemoryWordAddress::construct(cb, offset.clone());
   // lookup memory for first word
   cb.memory_lookup(
     0.expr(),
     address_word.addr_left(),
     value_left.expr(),
     value_left.expr(),
     None,
   );
   // let first_byte = value_left.cells[address_word.shift()];
   // constrain first byte is 0xef
   let is_first_byte_invalid = IsEqualGadget::construct(cb, first_byte.expr(),

```

Exploit Scenario
A malicious prover generates two different proofs for the same transaction, one leading to
the error state, and the other successfully executing the `CREATE` opcode. Distributing these
proofs to two ends of a bridge leads to state divergence and a loss of funds.


Recommendations
Short term, bind the `first_byte` witness value to the memory value; ensure that the
successful `CREATE` end state checks that the first byte is different from `0xef` .


Long term, investigate ways to generate malicious traces that could be added to the test
suite; every time a new soundness issue is found, create such a malicious trace and add it
to the test suite.

9. The OneHot primitive allows more than one value at once


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Cryptography Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL2-9


Target: `constraint_builder/binary_column.rs`


Description
The `OneHot` primitive uses `BinaryQuery` values as witness values. However, despite their
name, these values are not constrained to be Boolean values, allowing a malicious prover
to choose more than one “hot” value in the data structure.

```
 impl<T: IntoEnumIterator + Hash + Eq> OneHot<T> {
   pub fn configure<F: FieldExt>(

```

```
  cs: &mut ConstraintSystem<F>,
  cb: &mut ConstraintBuilder<F>,
) -> Self {

```

```
let mut columns = HashMap::new();
for variant in Self::nonfirst_variants() {

```

```
  columns.insert(variant, cb.binary_columns::<1>(cs)[0]) ;
}
let config = Self { columns };
cb.assert(

```

```
     "sum of binary columns in OneHot is 0 or 1",
     config.sum(0).or(!config.sum(0)),
  );
  config
}

```


_Figure 9.1:_ _`[mpt-circuit/src/gadgets/one_hot.rs#14–30](https://github.com/scroll-tech/mpt-circuit/blob/7b56d0b323e92ac11e54213520f6e7db41941cd0/src/gadgets/one_hot.rs#L14-L30)`_


The reason the `BinaryQuery` values are not constrained to be Boolean is because the
`BinaryColumn` configuration does not constrain the advice values to be Boolean, and the
configuration is simply a type wrapper around the `Column<Advice>` type. This provides no
guarantees to the users of this API, who might assume that these values are guaranteed to
be Boolean.

```
 pub fn configure<F: FieldExt>(
   cs: &mut ConstraintSystem<F>,
   _cb: &mut ConstraintBuilder<F>,
 ) -> Self {
   let advice_column = cs.advice_column();
   // TODO: constrain to be binary here...
   // cb.add_constraint()
   Self(advice_column)

The `OneHot` primitive is used to implement the Merkle path–checking state machine,
including critical properties such as requiring the `key` and `other_key` columns to remain
unchanged along a given Merkle path calculation, as shown in figure 9.3.

```
 cb.condition(
   !segment_type.current_matches(&[SegmentType::Start, SegmentType::AccountLeaf3]),
   |cb| {
     cb.assert_equal(
        "key can only change on Start or AccountLeaf3 rows",
        key.current(),
        key.previous(),
     );
     cb.assert_equal(
        "other_key can only change on Start or AccountLeaf3 rows",
        other_key.current(),
        other_key.previous(),
     );
   },
 );
```

We did not develop a proof-of-concept exploit for the path-checking table, so it may be the
case that the constraint in figure 9.3 is not exploitable due to other constraints. However, if
at any point it is possible to match both `SegmentType::Start` and some other segment
type (such as by setting one `OneHot` cell to `1` and another to `-1` ), a malicious prover would
be able to change the key partway through and forge Merkle updates.


Exploit Scenario
A malicious prover uses the `OneHot` soundness issue to bypass constraints, ensuring that
the `key` and `other_key` columns remain unchanged along a given Merkle path calculation.
This allows the attacker to successfully forge MPT update proofs that update an arbitrary
key.


Recommendations
Short term, add constraints that ensure that the advice values from these columns are
Boolean.


Long term, add positive and negative tests ensuring that these constraint builders operate
according to their expectations.

10. Intermediate columns are not explicit


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Cryptography Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL2-10


Target: `src/mpt_update.rs`


Description
The MPT update circuit includes two arrays of “intermediate value” columns, as shown in
figure 10.1.

```
 intermediate_values: [AdviceColumn; 10], // can be 4?
 second_phase_intermediate_values: [SecondPhaseAdviceColumn; 10], // 4?
```

These columns are used as general-use cells for values that are only conditionally needed
in a given row, reducing the total number of columns needed. For example, figure 10.2
shows that `intermediate_values[0]` is used for the `address` value in rows that match
`SegmentType::Start`, but as shown in figure 10.3, rows representing the
`SegmentType::AccountLeaf3` state of a Keccak code-hash proof use that same slot for
the `old_high` value.

```
 let address = self.intermediate_values[0].current() * is_start();

In some cases, cells of `intermediate_values` are used starting from the end of the
`intermediate_values` column, such as the `other_key_hash` and
`other_leaf_data_hash` values in `PathType::ExtensionOld` rows, as illustrated in
figure 10.4.

```
 let [.., key_equals_other_key, new_hash_is_zero] = config.is_zero_gadgets;
 let [.., other_key_hash, other_leaf_data_hash] = config.intermediate_values;

Although we did not find any mistakes such as misused columns, this pattern is ad hoc and
error-prone, and evaluating the correctness of this pattern requires checking every
individual use of `intermediate_values` .


Recommendations
Short term, document the assignment of all `intermediate_values` columns in each
relevant case.


Long term, consider using Rust types to express the different uses of the various
`intermediate_values` columns. For example, one could define an
`IntermediateValues` enum, with cases like `StartRow { address: &AdviceColumn }`
and `ExtensionOld { other_key_hash: &AdviceColumn, other_leaf_data_hash:`
`&AdviceColumn }`, and a single function `fn`
```
parse_intermediate_values(segment_type: SegmentType, path_type:
```

`PathType, columns: &[AdviceColumn; 10]) -> IntermediateValues` . Then, the
correct assignment and use of `intermediate_values` columns can be audited only by
checking `parse_intermediate_values` .

## C. Code Quality Findings

We identified the following code quality issues through manual and automatic code review.


**●** **Allow the** **`dead_code`** **lint and fix all issues.** The `dead_code` lint is currently
[disabled; it should be enabled to allow developers to quickly detect unused](https://github.com/scroll-tech/mpt-circuit/blob/7b56d0b323e92ac11e54213520f6e7db41941cd0/src/lib.rs#L1-L1)
functions and variables.


**●** **Several constraints have meaningless labels.** Constraint labels are useful for
explaining the intention behind constraints; using meaningless labels hinders code
readability.

**●** **There are duplicate and unused functions in the codebase.** The `[types.rs](https://github.com/scroll-tech/mpt-circuit/blob/7b56d0b323e92ac11e54213520f6e7db41941cd0/src/types.rs#L906-L906)` and

`split_word`, `hi_lo`, and `Bit` .


  - **The following constraint label was incorrectly copy-pasted.**

```
     cb.assert_equal(

- **There are redundant constraints in empty storage/account constraints.** The
`configure_empty_storage` and `configure_empty_account` functions require
the `new_value` and `old_value` fields to be `0` but also constrain them to be equal.


```
cb.assert_zero(
  "old value is 0 for empty storage",
  config.old_value.current(),

**●** **The following constraint label is imprecise.** The label should read
`rwc_inc_left[1] == rwc_inc_left[0] - rwc_diff, or 0 at the end` to match
the code.

```
   // Decrement rwc_inc_left for the next row, when an RW operation happens.
   let rwc_diff = is_rw_type.expr() * is_word_end.expr();
   let new_value = meta.query_advice(rwc_inc_left, CURRENT) - rwc_diff;
   // At the end, it must reach 0.

**●** **There is a redundant condition in the** **`configure_empty_account`** **function.**
The function could just match `SegmentType::Start` .

```
  SegmentType::Start | SegmentType::AccountTrie => {
     let is_final_segment =
  config.segment_type.next_matches(&[SegmentType::Start]);
     cb.condition(is_final_segment, |cb| {

**●** **There is a redundant** **`.and()`** **call in the** **`MptUpdateConfig configure`** **function.**
The `cb.every_row_selector()` function returns the first condition in the
condition stack, so this condition is equivalent to `is_start` .

```
   cb.condition(is_start.clone().and(cb.every_row_selector()), |cb| {
```

_Figure C.10:_ _`[mpt-circuit/src/gadgets/mpt_update.rs#124](https://github.com/scroll-tech/mpt-circuit/blob/7b56d0b323e92ac11e54213520f6e7db41941cd0/src/gadgets/mpt_update.rs#L124)`_


**●** **The** **`rw_counter`** **constraints could be consolidated.** Constraining `rw_counter`
requires constraining the tag to `Memory` or `TxLog` and constraining the `Padding` to
`0` . These constraints are implemented in different locations in the codebase, making
the code harder to understand.

```
   let is_rw_type = meta.query_advice(is_memory, CURRENT) + is_tx_log.expr();

**●** **The following constraint label is imprecise.** The label should read `assign`
`real_bytes_left {}` .

```
   // real_bytes_left
   region.assign_advice(
     || format!("assign bytes_left {}", *offset),
     self.copy_table.real_bytes_left,

## D. Automated Analysis Tool Confgurationi

As part of this assessment, we used the tools described below to perform automated
testing of the codebase.


D.1. Semgrep

[We used the static analyzer Semgrep to search for risky API patterns and weaknesses in the](https://semgrep.dev/)
source code repository. For this purpose, we wrote rules specifically targeting the
`ConstraintBuilder` APIs and the `ExecutionGadget` trait.

```
 semgrep --metrics=off --sarif --config=custom_rule_path.yml
```

_Figure D.1: The invocation command used to run Semgrep for each custom rule_


Duplicate Constraints
The presence of duplicate constraints, with potentially different labels, indicates either a
redundant constraint that can be removed or an intended constraint that was not correctly
updated. This pattern was written to find variants of finding TOB-SCROLL2-6, but no other
instances of it were found in the codebase. However, this pattern should be added as a
CI/CD Semgrep rule to prevent a similar issue from recurring in the codebase.

```
 rules:
 - id: repeated-constraints
  message: "Found redundant or incorrectly updated constraint"
  languages: [rust]
  severity: ERROR
  patterns:
   - pattern: |
     cb.$FUNC($LABEL1, $LEFT, $RIGHT);
     ...
     cb.$FUNC($LABEL2, $LEFT, $RIGHT);
```

_Figure D.2: The_ _`repeated-constraints`_ _Semgrep rule_


Constraints with Repeated Labels
The presence of a repeated label could indicate a copy-pasted label that should be
updated.

```
 rules:
 - id: constraints-with-repeated-labels
  message: "Found constraints with the same label"
  languages: [rust]
  severity: ERROR
  patterns:
   - pattern: |

```
     cb.$FUNC("$LABEL", ...);
     ...
     cb.$FUNC("$LABEL", ...);
```

_Figure D.3: The_ _`repeated-labels`_ _Semgrep rule_


D.2. cargo llvm-cov

`[cargo-llvm-cov](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov)` generates Rust code coverage reports. We used the `cargo llvm-cov`
`--open` command in the MPT codebase to generate the coverage report presented in the
Automated Testing section.


D.3. cargo edit

`[cargo-edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit)` allows developers to quickly find outdated Rust crates. The tool can be
installed with the `cargo install cargo-edit` command and the `cargo upgrade`
`--incompatible --dry-run` command can be used to find outdated crates.


D.4. Clippy

[The Rust linter Clippy can be installed using](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) `rustup` by running the command `rustup`
`component add clippy` . Invoking `cargo clippy --workspace -- -W clippy::pedantic`
in the root directory of the project runs the tool with the pedantic ruleset.

```
 cargo clippy --workspace -- -W clippy::pedantic
```

## E. Fix Review Results

When undertaking a fix review, Trail of Bits reviews the fixes implemented for issues
identified in the original report. This work involves a review of specific areas of the source
code and system configuration, not comprehensive analysis of the system.


From September 25 to September 29, 2023, Trail of Bits reviewed the fixes and mitigations
implemented by the Scroll team for the issues identified in this report. We reviewed each
fix to determine its effectiveness in resolving the associated issue.


Scroll provided PRs with fixes for all high-severity findings and for the
informational-severity finding TOB-SCROLL2-7. Scroll did not submit fixes for the remaining
informational-severity findings.


In summary, of the 10 issues described in this report, Scroll has resolved three issues and
has partially resolved one issue. Scroll indicated that it does not intend to fix finding
TOB-SCROLL2-2, so its status is unresolved. No fix PRs were provided for the remaining five
issues, so their fix statuses are undetermined. For additional information, please see the

#### Detailed Fix Review Results

**TOB-SCROLL2-1: PoseidonLookup is not implemented**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-SCROLL2-2: IsZeroGadget does not constrain the inverse witness when the value**
**is zero**
Unresolved. The Scroll team has indicated that it does not intend to fix this issue.


**TOB-SCROLL2-3: The MPT nonexistence proof gadget is missing constraints specified**
**in the documentation**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-SCROLL2-4: Discrepancies between the MPT circuit specification and**
**implementation**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-SCROLL2-5: Redundant lookups in the Word RLC circuit**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-SCROLL2-6: The NonceChanged configuration circuit does not constrain the new**
**value nonce value**
[Resolved in PR #73. The two conditional constraints that referred to](https://github.com/scroll-tech/mpt-circuit/pull/73) `old_value` instead of
`new_value` have been factored out into a single unconditional constraint referring to
`new_value`, and the `ExtensionOld` case has been removed entirely in favor of a blanket
assertion forbidding that case of `configure_nonce` .


**TOB-SCROLL2-7: The Copy circuit does not totally enforce the tag values**
[Partially resolved in PR #809. Several cases of the](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/809) `CopyDataType` tag have been removed,
and an assertion has been added to document that the `Padding` tag value is internal only.
We did not fully evaluate whether this prevents tag values outside the expected range.


**TOB-SCROLL2-8: The “invalid creation” error handling circuit is unconstrained**
[Resolved in PR #751. The](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/751) `MemoryMask` gadget is used to extract the correct byte from the
word at `offset` and to constrain it to equal `0xef` .


**TOB-SCROLL2-9: The OneHot primitive allows more than one value at once**
[Resolved in PR #69. Each binary column value](https://github.com/scroll-tech/mpt-circuit/pull/69) `v` is constrained by enforcing `1 - v.or(!v)`
`== 0` . It is not immediately obvious that this constraint suffices, but it is equivalent to

𝑣(1 −𝑣) = 0 by the following reasoning:


Trail of Bits 48 Scroll zkEVM Circuits Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


```
1 - v.or(!v) == 1 - !((!v).and(!!v) == 1 - (1 - ((!v)*(!!v))) …

… == ((1-v)*(1-(1-v))) == (1-v)*v

```

In addition, another related issue with the `OneHot` primitive, which was not discovered
[during the initial review engagement, was fixed in PR #68. The related problem was a typo](https://github.com/scroll-tech/mpt-circuit/pull/68)
causing `OneHot::previous` to return the result of the current row rather than the
previous row. Its exploit scenario would be effectively the same as the one described in
finding TOB-SCROLL2-9. The Scroll team fixed this by replacing the value
`BinaryColumn::current` with `BinaryColumn::previous` .


**TOB-SCROLL2-10: Intermediate columns are not explicit**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.
