## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Scroll engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the Scroll rollup and bridge smart
contract changes for the Feynman upgrade. The smart contract changes include the
removal of old, unused code and a few new additions, such as a new system config
contract for the L2, a new pause controller contract, a new zkEVM verifier, and a few
changes to bridge contracts on both L1 and L2 sides.


A team of one consultant conducted the review from June 30 to July 4, 2025, for a total of
one engineer-week of effort. With full access to source code and documentation, we
performed static and dynamic testing of the target codebase, using automated and manual
processes.

#### Observations and Impact

The smart contract changes are minimal and simple to understand. Our testing efforts
focused on the newly added functionality. We checked the PauseController contract for
the correct implementation of the access control checks, along with the pause and
unpause functionality. We verified the access control checks in the L2SystemConfig
contract. We checked the arithmetic operations for the integer overflow issues in the
L1GasPriceOracle contract changes. We verified that the ZkEvmVerifierPostFeynman
contract encodes the verifier input correctly. We checked the L1ScrollMessenger and
L2ScrollMessenger contracts for correctness, transaction replay vulnerabilities, and
other common Solidity smart contract vulnerabilities.


Our review uncovered two issues: a failed transaction replay functionality that can be
exploited for malicious purposes (TOB-SCRFMSC-1), and an ineffective access control check
(TOB-SCRFMSC-2).


We also identified an opportunity to improve the test cases to test a production-like setup.
This does not constitute a security issue and thus is not included in the detailed findings
section, but we note it here as a way to improve the codebase’s security.

#### Recommendations

Remediate the findings disclosed in this report. Improve the PauseController test case
setup to emulate the production environment. Update the user and third-party integration
documentation to include known vulnerabilities and limitations, making users and
developers aware of these vulnerabilities and their solutions.

## Detailed Findings

1. Old failed L1 to L2 messages can be executed by anyone on behalf of a user


Severity: **Undetermined** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCRFMSC-1


Target: src/L1/L1ScrollMessenger.sol


Description
Anyone can retry a failed message from L1 to L2 any number of times until it is successful.
An attacker can execute old failed messages sent from L1 to L2 by users.


The replayMessage function of the L1ScrollMessenger contract allows users to retry a
failed L1 to L2 message with a higher gas limit. It allows anyone to retry a failed message
sent by anyone. Additionally, there is no way for a user to cancel their failed L1-to-L2
message. This can lead to an unexpected outcome, potentially leading to a loss to the user:
when a user assumes that an old message cannot be executed because of an error, it later
becomes executable because of a state change in the target smart contract, and then it is
executed by an attacker.


function replayMessage(
address _from,
address _to,
uint256 _value,
uint256 _messageNonce,
bytes memory _message,
uint32 _newGasLimit,
address _refundAddress
) external payable override whenNotPaused notInExecution {
[...]
ReplayState memory _replayState = replayStates[_xDomainCalldataHash];
// update the replayed message chain.
unchecked {
if (_replayState.lastIndex == 0) {
// the message has not been replayed before.
prevReplayIndex[_nextQueueIndex] = _messageNonce + 1;
} else {
prevReplayIndex[_nextQueueIndex] = _replayState.lastIndex + 1;
}
}
_replayState.lastIndex = uint128(_nextQueueIndex);

replayStates[_xDomainCalldataHash] = _replayState;

// refund fee to `_refundAddress`
unchecked {
uint256 _refund = msg.value     - _fee;
if (_refund     - 0) {
(bool _success, ) = _refundAddress.call{value: _refund}("");
require(_success, "Failed to refund the fee");
}
}
}

Exploit Scenario
Alice sends a message from L1 to L2. The target contract in the L2 chain reverts as it is
paused, and the message is not marked executed in the L2ScrollMessenger contract.
Alice tries it three times and then gives up on it. Alice then forgets about it. After a month,
Eve sees that the message can now be executed as the target contract has been unpaused.
Eve replays the message on behalf of Alice, and this time it is successfully executed on L2.
Alice, having forgotten about the failed transaction, is surprised to see its effect after a
month. Alice sees her funds transferred without her action and worries that her wallet has
been hacked.


Recommendations
Short term, add a check in the replayMessage function to prevent messages older than a
certain deadline from replaying. Document this behaviour to make users and third-party
integrators aware of this issue and its potential fixes.


Long term, follow the least privilege principle when designing systems. Consider adding a
cancellation mechanism or a deadline to unauthenticated transactions to prevent
unexpected transaction executions.

2. Malicious submissions to commitAndFinalizeBatch can break off-chain
indexers


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Access Controls Finding ID: TOB-SCRFMSC-2


Target: src/L1/L1ScrollMessenger.sol


Description
Scroll L1 indexers parse top-level transaction call data in order to track commitment and
finalization of batches. In order to ensure that all necessary data for indexing the chain is
present in the top-level transaction, the commitAndFinalizeBatch function (figure 2.1)
uses a modifier, OnlyTopLevelCall (figure 2.2), which is designed to prevent calls from
smart contracts or EIP-7702 delegated EOAs. The modifier is ineffective as written, as smart
contract constructors may issue calls to the commitAndFinalizeBatch function. Because
smart contracts have empty code prior to the return of the constructor call frame, the
OnlyTopLevelCall will not revert.


function commitAndFinalizeBatch(
uint8 version,
bytes32 parentBatchHash,
FinalizeStruct calldata finalizeStruct
) external OnlyTopLevelCall {

_Figure 2.1: The declaration of commitAndFinalizeBatch_
_[(scroll-contracts/src/L1/rollup/ScrollChain.sol#396–400)](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-contracts/blob/00e2a897db429eb4bc3918d1e40b410a68fb6eac/src/L1/rollup/ScrollChain.sol#L396-L400)_


modifier OnlyTopLevelCall() {
// disallow contract accounts and delegated EOAs
if (msg.sender.code.length != 0) revert ErrorTopLevelCallRequired();
_;
}

_Figure 2.2: Definition of the OnlyTopLevelCall modifier_
_[(scroll-contracts/src/L1/rollup/ScrollChain.sol#199–203)](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-contracts/blob/00e2a897db429eb4bc3918d1e40b410a68fb6eac/src/L1/rollup/ScrollChain.sol#L199-L203)_


In normal operation, only the privileged Scroll sequence may submit batches to the
ScrollChain smart contract. However, when the Scroll sequencer fails to post or finalize
batches for an extended period of time, the ScrollChain contract enters an enforced
liveness mode in which users can permissionlessly commit and finalize L2 batches. In this
mode, malicious actors may be able to call the function from a smart contract context and
cause off-chain indexers to crash or report incorrect data, as the top-level call data will no
longer reflect the ABI-encoded call to commitAndFinalizeBatch.


​

**PUBLIC​** **​** Security Assessment


Exploit Scenario
A sequencer bug causes the main Scroll sequencer to stop posting blocks, causing the
ScrollChain contract to enter Enforced Mode. Users who want to withdraw funds from
the Scroll L2 chain begin manually committing batches using commitAndFinalizeBatch.
Mallory, hoping to manipulate markets by creating panic, begins submitting batches using
smart contract constructors. Off-chain indexers attempt to parse the transaction calldata
from the top-level message but panic when attempting to parse the top-level call, which
now contains maliciously constructed data.


Recommendations
Short term, add a check that msg.sender == tx.origin to the OnlyTopLevelCall
modifier. Because contract constructors can never execute in the context of an EOA
address, this will prevent smart contracts from calling the function.


Long term, consider adding events to the commitAndFinalizeBatch so that the full
transition is captured by indexed events. This will reduce the dependence on the more
fragile calldata parsing mechanism.

Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.
