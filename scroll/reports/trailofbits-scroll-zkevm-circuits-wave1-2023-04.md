#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Scroll engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of its zkEVM halo2 circuits. The scoped
codebase implements the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) opcodes, as well as other
crucial components of Scroll’s zkEVM: the State circuit, the Bytecode circuit, and the circuit
for the `modexp` precompile. Additionally, we were tasked with reviewing changes to the
Keccak circuit and to the `halo2-lib` and `snark-verifier` circuits.


A team of four consultants conducted the review from April 17 to June 23, 2023, for a total
of 23 engineer-weeks of effort. Our testing efforts focused on circuit soundness and the
correct implementation of the EVM semantics. With full access to the source code and
documentation, we performed static and dynamic testing of the zkEVM halo2 circuits, using
automated and manual processes.

#### Observations and Impact

The security review revealed many high-impact vulnerabilities related to circuit soundness.
Due to incorrect, incomplete, or missing constraints, a malicious prover could convince a
verifier of an EVM execution that does not match the correct EVM semantics. Specifically,
an attacker could cause opcodes to return an unintended result (TOB-SCROLL-1,
TOB-SCROLL-3), manipulate gas costs of certain opcodes (TOB-SCROLL-7, TOB-SCROLL-12),
execute different opcodes from what was specified in the bytecode (TOB-SCROLL-13,
TOB-SCROLL-14), or call certain opcodes in situations where doing so should not be
allowed according to the EVM specification (TOB-SCROLL-9). All of these cases could lead to
state divergence and cause loss of funds if the zkEVM is used in the context of a bridge. The
gas costs manipulation issues could also enable denial-of-service attacks, and finding
TOB-SCROLL-9 could enable reentrancy attacks at the contract level.

#### Recommendations

Based on the codebase maturity evaluation and findings identified during the security
review, Trail of Bits recommends that Scroll take the following steps before deployment:


  - **Remediate the findings disclosed in this report.** These findings should be
addressed as part of a direct remediation or as part of any refactoring that may
occur when addressing other recommendations.


  - **Invest in adversarial testing.** The security requirements of a zkEVM
implementation are extremely strict, and the complexity of evaluating such an
implementation is extremely high. The use of nondeterministic computation in a
complex circuit such as the zkEVM is simultaneously a crucial optimization
technique and a source of potentially catastrophic errors, as described in
TOB-SCROLL-13. Even errors that seem extremely minor, such as TOB-SCROLL-7,


Trail of Bits 5 Scroll zkEVM halo2 Circuits Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


can lead to divergent execution. And even in the absence of divergent execution
bugs, the complexity of executing EVM bytecode provides a wealth of potential
implementation mistakes, where minor errors can cause state divergence if a zkEVM
is improperly deployed as part of a cross-chain bridge—for example, if one side of
the bridge uses the zkEVM circuit and the other uses a `go-ethereum`
implementation tweaked in accordance with Scroll’s public documentation. In
addition, any of these errors can be introduced by seemingly innocuous changes
during the development process.


With all of these considerations in mind, we believe that this project requires an
unusually high level of assurance and will continue to need active testing and review
throughout its lifetime. We strongly encourage Scroll to invest in an ongoing,
adversarial testing process, especially focused on potential malicious prover
behavior. We also encourage Scroll to develop a clear written specification for each
specialized argument (e.g., the RW table, RLC-based words) used in the final
implementation. Finally, invest in a continuous internal code-reviewing effort.


**●** **Leverage the Rust type system to enforce compile-time invariants.** The Rust
type system should be used to ensure that certain witness values have been
constrained. As an example, certain Boolean operations defined in the codebase
require their arguments to be Boolean. However, ensuring that the arguments are
Boolean is currently either enforced in an ad hoc manner or sometimes not even
enforced, leading to potential soundness issues. Defining new Rust types and
signatures for the Boolean functions and the
`ConstraintBuilder::query_bool()` function would allow developers to know
that those values are Boolean-constrained. This mechanism also can improve
efficiency by preventing potential double-enforcement of the same constraint.

## Project Goals

The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of the Scroll zkEVM halo2
circuits. Specifically, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list of questions:


  - Are the circuits implementing the EVM opcodes properly enforcing the EVM
semantics? Are the circuits sound and complete?


  - Are EVM state semantics properly enforced? Are state-changing opcodes allowed
within a static context?


  - Are the fixed lookup tables properly populated?


  - Are the lookup tables properly constrained to prevent malicious insertions?


  - Is the EVM execution control flow correctly enforced? Can a malicious prover
provide different execution traces for the same State-Transaction input?


  - Can a malicious prover convince a verifier of a different final state than what
running the EVM would reach?


  - Does the constraint builder API correctly enforce the intended constraints?


  - How are opcode-to-opcode transitions enforced? How are opcode-to-error
transitions enforced?


  - Could an attacker trace lead to an error state when the correct execution should not
error? Could the opposite also occur?


  - Are memory semantics correctly guaranteed by the RW table constraints?


  - Do the code changes to `halo2-lib`, `snark-verifier`, or the Keccak circuit
introduce any vulnerabilities?


  - Do the code changes improve readability and code maintainability?


  - For a correct Fiat-Shamir transformation, are the statement and all prover messages
included in the transcript?

## Project Coverage

This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by
our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:


  - We manually reviewed the zkEVM circuit, including the mathematical gadgets,
utilities, and all EVM opcode gadgets. We checked for circuit soundness issues,
opcode edge cases, underconstrained witness values, and correct state transition
enforcement. If we identified vulnerable code patterns or code smells, we used
Semgrep to perform variant analysis and search for other instances of the same
patterns.


  - We manually reviewed the RW table circuits, especially focused on lookups
performed in execution gadgets in the
`zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/execution/` directory and the structural
constraints in the `zkevm-circuits/src/state_circuit/` directory.


  - We manually reviewed the Bytecode table consistency circuit, including its Poseidon
extended column variant. We checked the correct enforcement of the specified
constraints. We looked for potential ways to break the soundness of the circuit.


  - We manually reviewed the Keccak circuit code, particularly the files in the
`zkevm-circuits/src/keccak_circuit/` directory.


  - We manually reviewed the `halo2-lib` and `snark-verifier` diffs, paying special
attention to changes in the `snark-verifier/src/pcs.rs` file, as well as the
`snark-verifier/src/pcs/` directory.


  - We manually reviewed the `modexp` precompile circuit. At the time of the audit, the
circuit was still being developed and was incomplete in terms of features and
engineering work; the current version of the circuit does not support arbitrary
length values like the EVM `modexp` precompile, and there are several empty
functions, which impact the soundness and completeness of the circuit.

## Automated Testing

Trail of Bits uses automated techniques to extensively test the security properties of
software. We use both open-source static analysis and fuzzing utilities, along with tools
developed in-house, to perform automated testing of source code and compiled software.

#### Test Harness Configuration

We used the following tools in the automated testing phase of this project:

enforcing code standards when editing or committing code
and during build time


Clippy An open-source Rust linter used to catch common mistakes
and unidiomatic Rust code

#### Areas of Focus

Our automated testing and verification focused on the following:

## Codebase Maturity Evaluation

Trail of Bits uses a traffic-light protocol to provide each client with a clear understanding of
the areas in which its codebase is mature, immature, or underdeveloped. Deficiencies
identified here often stem from root causes within the software development life cycle that
should be addressed through standardization measures (e.g., the use of common libraries,
functions, or frameworks) or training and awareness programs.


**Category** **Summary** **Result**



Arithmetic We found no issues related to the use of integer
arithmetic in the codebase.



Complexity
Management


Cryptography
and Key
Management



The codebase is well organized and separated into files
and folders. Specific gadget implementations are also
cleanly implemented and separate the constraint
generation from the witness generation. This separation
allows better scrutiny of the constraints imposed in each
circuit.


On the other hand, the execution of the zkEVM depends
on nondeterministic programming patterns, which are
hard to reason about and to have a global understanding
of. We found two instances where a malicious prover
could hijack the execution flow of the executing
bytecode: TOB-SCROLL-13 and TOB-SCROLL-14.


We found no issues related to the use of cryptography
primitives in the codebase.


However, the codebase depends upon an outdated
version of the `halo2-ecc` library, which has had several
updates made to its cryptographic primitives, as
described in TOB-SCROLL-4. All uses of `halo2-ecc`
cryptographic primitives should be carefully reviewed,
and Scroll should use an up-to-date and well-tested
version of that library.



**Satisfactory**

Documentation There are several sources of documentation instead of
one centralized and up-to-date documentation. It is
common to find missing or incomplete sections of
documentation, which should be addressed. We also

Verification



found that while some documentation has the general
design description, it frequently lacks correctness
requirements.


The `zkevm-circuits` project uses no unsafe Rust code.
We found one runtime panic during witness generation:
TOB-SCROLL-26.


The codebase uses geth tracing to obtain values for
witness generation. By using geth as ground truth, tests
will mostly exercise the completeness aspect of the
circuits.


As we found many high-severity findings related to circuit
soundness (TOB-SCROLL-1, TOB-SCROLL-3,
TOB-SCROLL-7, TOB-SCROLL-9, TOB-SCROLL-12,
TOB-SCROLL-13, TOB-SCROLL-14), we believe it is
necessary to develop an adversarial testing process,
especially focused on malicious prover behavior. Formal
methods to check for, such as circuit determinacy, should
also be considered for research.


We also found gadgets without tests (e.g.,
`binary_number.rs`, `rlp.rs` ) and ignored tests (e.g., in
`jump.rs` ). Tests should be reenabled and added where
there are none. We also recommend adding the test
vectors for all EIPs that the codebase implements. As an
example, the `SSTORE` gas refund EIP is implemented in
the codebase, but its test vectors are not present in the
codebase to ensure a correct implementation.

## Detailed Findings

1. ModGadget is underconstrained and allows incorrect MULMOD operations
to be proven


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-1


Target: `zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/util/math_gadget/modulo.rs`


Description
The `ModGadget` circuit computes the modulo operation, `a mod n`, with the caveat that the
result should be `0` whenever `n` is `0` . However, an incorrect constraint allows a proof that
that `a mod 0 == a` . This causes incorrect EVM semantics for the `MULMOD` opcode, allowing an
attacker to prove that `a*b` `mod` `0` `==` `a*b` . According to the EVM semantics, the correct
result is `0` .


The `ModGadget` circuit implementation uses a witness value, `a_or_zero`, that is supposed
to take the value of `a` when `n` is nonzero or `0` when `n` is `0` . The code comments indicate that
the following constraint ensures that `a_or_zero` satisfies this condition, but the constraint
also allows the case `a_or_zero == a` and `n == 0` :

```
 /// Constraints for the words a, n, r:
 /// a mod n = r, if n!=0
 /// r = 0, if n==0
 ///
 /// We use the auxiliary a_or_zero word, whose value is constrained to be:
 /// a_or_zero = a if n!=0, 0 if n==0. This allows to use the equation
 /// k * n + r = a_or_zero to verify the modulus, which holds with r=0 in the
 /// case of n=0. Unlike the usual k * n + r = a, which forces r = a when n=0,
 /// this equation assures that r<n or r=n=0.
 ...
 impl<F: Field> ModGadget<F> {
   pub(crate) fn construct(cb: &mut ConstraintBuilder<F>, words: [&util::Word<F>;
 3]) -> Self {
     let (a, n, r) = (words[0], words[1], words[2]);
     let k = cb.query_word_rlc();
     let a_or_zero = cb.query_word_rlc();
     let n_is_zero = IsZeroGadget::construct(cb, sum::expr(&n.cells));
     let a_or_is_zero = IsZeroGadget::construct(cb, sum::expr(&a_or_zero.cells));
     let mul_add_words = MulAddWordsGadget::construct(cb, [&k, n, r,
 &a_or_zero]);
     let eq = IsEqualGadget::construct(cb, a.expr(), a_or_zero.expr());

```

     // Constrain the aux variable a_or_zero to be =a or =0 if n==0:

     cb.add_constraint(
        " (1 - (a == a_or_zero)) * ( 1 - (n == 0) * (a_or_zero == 0)",
        (1.expr() - eq.expr()) * (1.expr() - n_is_zero.expr() *
 a_or_is_zero.expr()),

```

To correctly constrain the `a_or_zero` variable, rewrite the constraint as the following:

```
   [1 - ((n==0)*(a_or_zero==0) + (1 - n==0) * (a_or_zero == a)))] == 0

Exploit Scenario
A bridge uses the Scroll zkEVM to track the current state of Ethereum. A malicious prover
generates a proof of execution for a transaction involving the `MULMOD` instruction with

𝑛= 0, and sets the result to 𝑎· 𝑏 as described above. The prover submits that proof, the
results of which will not match the correct EVM semantics, leading to state divergence and
loss of funds.


Recommendations
Short term, fix the constraint; extend the `assign` function to receive the `a_or_zero`
witness. Add tests for this finding.


Long term, add determinacy testing to any gadgets that constrain nondeterministic
witnesses.

2. The RlpU64Gadget is underconstrained when is_lt_128 is false


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-2


Target: z `kevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/util/math_gadget/rlp.rs`


Description
The `RlpU64Gadget` constrains witness values to match the output of a correct RLP
encoding. Since the length and value of the RLP-encoded value depend on the value being
less than 128, the `is_lt_128` flag is part of the witness. A range check ensures that if
`is_lt_128` is true, then the value is actually below 128. However, there is no constraint
ensuring that `value` is above 127 when `is_lt_128` is false:

```
 let is_lt_128 = cb.query_bool();
 cb.condition(is_lt_128.expr(), |cb| {
   cb.range_lookup(value, 128);
 });
```

This means that a malicious prover could have a value smaller than 128 but set `is_lt_128`
to false, leading to an incorrect length and RLP-encoded output.


Exploit Scenario
A malicious prover interprets two bytes in an RLP-serialized data structure as a value less
than 128, causing later fields in the data structure to be deserialized starting at an incorrect
offset. The prover then uses this incorrectly deserialized data structure to prove an invalid
state transition, leading to state divergence and potential loss of funds.


Recommendations
Short term, add a constraint to ensure that the value is above 127 when `is_lt_128` is
false.


Long term, add negative tests ensuring that mismatched witnesses `value` and `is_lt_128`
do not satisfy the circuit constraints.

3. The BLOCKHASH opcode is underconstrained and allows the hash of any
block to be computed


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-3


Target: z `kevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/util/math_gadget/rlp.rs`


Description
The `BLOCKHASH` opcode returns the hash of the block identified by the stack argument,
`block_number`, provided that it is one of the 256 most recent complete blocks. However,
the implementation allows a malicious prover to provide a nonzero result even when the
provided block number is not among the 256 most recent blocks, contradicting the EVM
specification.


To validate that `block_number` is among the 256 most recent blocks, the implementation
checks that `current_block_number - block_number < 257`, where
`current_block_number` is supposed to be the block number of the current block.
However, `current_block_number` is unconstrained and could take any value:

```
 impl<F: Field> ExecutionGadget<F> for BlockHashGadget<F> {
   const NAME: &'static str = "BLOCKHASH";

   const EXECUTION_STATE: ExecutionState = ExecutionState::BLOCKHASH;

```

```
fn configure(cb: &mut ConstraintBuilder<F>) -> Self {

```

```
     let current_block_number = cb.query_cell();
     let block_number = WordByteCapGadget::construct(cb,
current_block_number.expr());

```

```
cb.stack_pop(block_number.original_word());

```

```
   // FIXME
   // cb.block_lookup(
   // BlockContextFieldTag::Number.expr(),
   // cb.curr.state.block_number.expr(),
   // current_block_number.expr(),
   // );

   let block_hash = cb.query_word_rlc();

   let diff_lt = LtGadget::construct(
      cb,
      current_block_number.expr(),
      (NUM_PREV_BLOCK_ALLOWED + 1).expr() + block_number.valid_value(),

A malicious prover could provide an invalid `current_block_number` and return the hash
of any block present in the block lookup table, independent of its block number.


Exploit Scenario
A malicious prover generates a proof of execution for a transaction involving the
`BLOCKHASH` opcode that results in a nonzero hash for an older block. The prover submits
that proof, the results of which will not match the correct EVM semantics, leading to state
divergence and loss of funds.


Recommendations
Short term, add the missing lookup constraint for the `current_block_number` witness.


Long term, track and triage “FIXME” and “TODO” items in a centralized issue tracking
system, such as GitHub issues. Add failing tests when security-relevant “TODO” items are

Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Patching Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-4


Target: z `kevm-circuits/{Cargo.toml,src/tx_circuit/sign_verify.rs}`


Description
The `zkevm-circuits` crate depends on the `halo2-ecc` library in Scroll’s fork of
`halo2-lib`, which provides `halo2` circuits for elliptic curve and finite field operations. As
illustrated in figure 4.1, this crate depends on the `halo2-ecc-snark-verifier-0323` tag,
which currently points to commit `d24871338ade7dd56362de517b718ba14f3e7b90` .

```

The Scroll fork of `halo2-lib` is closely related to the upstream `halo2-lib` library. In
particular, the `v0.3.0` version of `halo2-ecc` (commit
`c31a30bcaff384b0c3aa7c823dd343f5c85da69e` ) has a common ancestor commit of
`4338af81bb2de4f278467e5c484e067c064cc66b` with the Scroll version.


_Figure 4.2: The Git commit history of_ _`halo2-lib`_ _with the common ancestor of the_

_`minimize-diff`_ _and_ _`upgrade-v0.3.0`_ _branches highlighted_


The upstream library has various fixes and improvements that should be incorporated.
Some notable existing fixes include the following:


  - `FpChip::assert_equal` [has had a soundness-related typo fixed (PR #18).](https://github.com/axiom-crypto/halo2-lib/pull/18)


Trail of Bits 23 Scroll zkEVM halo2 Circuits Security Assessment

  - `ecdsa_verify_no_pubkey_check` [no longer rejects certain valid signatures (PR](https://github.com/axiom-crypto/halo2-lib/pull/36)
[#36).](https://github.com/axiom-crypto/halo2-lib/pull/36)


While `FpChip::assert_equal` does not currently appear to be used, the
`SignVerifyChip` circuit uses the `ecdsa_verify_no_pubkey_check` function, as shown
in figure 4.3.

```
 // returns the verification result of ecdsa signature
 //
 // WARNING: this circuit does not enforce the returned value to be true
 // make sure the caller checks this result!

`SignVerify` is then used to check signatures on EVM transactions, as shown in figure 4.4,
and because of the pre-patch behavior, an adversary can generate a correctly signed
transaction that will nevertheless fail signature verification.

```

Exploit Scenario
An adversary creates a transaction with a valid signature that the old implementation
would reject and submits it to Ethereum. Ethereum accepts the transaction, but the Scroll
zkEVM is unable to accept it, stalling the zkEVM and creating a denial of service that may
freeze user funds.


Recommendations
Short term, review the security implications of this outdated version of `halo2-ecc` on the
zkEVM codebase. Then, either update to a more recent version of `halo2-lib` that
incorporates upstream fixes or backport those fixes to Scroll’s fork.


Long term, keep all dependencies up to date whenever possible. For any dependencies that
have been forked from the upstream version, develop a plan to port any upstream security

5. N_BYTES parameters are not checked to prevent overflow

Target:

```
 t}.rs

```

Description
The `ConstantDivisionGadget` and `LtGadget` circuits implement operations on
multi-byte integers: division by a constant value and comparison, respectively. Each circuit
has a generic parameter `N_BYTES` representing the number of bytes used. However, each
of these circuits has additional implied restrictions on `N_BYTES` required to prevent
unexpected behavior due to overflowing field elements.


In `ConstantDivisionGadget` (shown in figure 5.1), the `quotient` value is constrained to

𝑁_𝐵𝑌𝑇𝐸𝑆
be less than 256, but the expression `quotient.expr() * denominator.expr()`

may overflow if `denominator` is sufficiently large (e.g., if `denominator` is `1024` and
`N_BYTES` is `31` . The comment highlighted in figure 5.2 provides sufficient conditions to
prevent overflow, but these are not fully enforced either in the circuit or in assertions at
circuit construction time.

```
 let quotient = cb.query_cell_with_type(CellType::storage_for_expr(&numerator));
 let remainder = cb.query_cell_with_type(CellType::storage_for_expr(&numerator));

 // Require that remainder < denominator
 cb.range_lookup(remainder.expr(), denominator);

 // Require that quotient < 256**N_BYTES
 // so we can't have any overflow when doing `quotient * denominator`.
 let quotient_range_check = RangeCheckGadget::construct(cb, quotient.expr());

 // Check if the division was done correctly
 cb.require_equal(
   "numerator - remainder == quotient ⋅ denominator",
   numerator - remainder.expr(),
   quotient.expr() * denominator.expr(),
 );

In `LtGadget` (shown in figure 5.3), values of `N_BYTES` above 31 will cause `lt` to be an
unconstrained Boolean, since a malicious prover can set `diff` to the representation of
`(rhs - lhs)` even if `rhs < lhs` . The comment highlighted in figure 5.4 describes sufficient
conditions to prevent overflow without changes to the circuit, but these restrictions are
enforced only by a `debug_assert!` in `from_bytes::expr` (shown in figure 5.5).

```
 let lt = cb.query_bool();
 let diff = cb.query_bytes();
 let range = pow_of_two(N_BYTES * 8);

7. Underconstrained warm status on CALL opcodes allows gas cost forgery


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-7


Target: z `kevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/execution/callop.rs`


Description
An underconstrained variable in the `CallOpGadget` allows an attacker to prove the
execution of a transaction with incorrect gas costs by setting an address as cold when it
should become warm.


The `CallOpGadget` implements the `CALL`, `CALLCODE`, `DELEGATECALL`, and `STATICCALL`
EVM opcodes. The gas cost of these opcodes depends on whether the callee address is
warm. Additionally, the implementation of these opcodes must make the address warm so
that future calls to the same address cost less gas. However, the variable that controls the
address’s new warm status is not constrained and is referenced only in the write to the RW
table:

```
 // Add callee to access list
 let is_warm = cb.query_bool();
 let is_warm_prev = cb.query_bool();
 cb.account_access_list_write(
   tx_id.expr(),
   call_gadget.callee_address_expr(),
   is_warm. expr(),
   is_warm_prev.expr(),
   Some(&mut reversion_info),
 );
```

_Figure 7.1:_ _`[zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/execution/callop.rs#L129-L138](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e8bcb23e1f303bd6e0dc52924b0ed85710b8a016/zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/execution/callop.rs#L129-L138)`_


This means that a malicious prover can make the `is_warm` variable equal `false`, causing a
called address to actually become cold during the execution of a `CALL`, instead of warm as
in the EVM specification.


[A constraint on the RW table, requiring that the initial value of the access list elements is](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e8bcb23e1f303bd6e0dc52924b0ed85710b8a016/zkevm-circuits/src/state_circuit/constraint_builder.rs#L344-L347)
always false, prevents another possible scenario where the `is_warm_prev` value could be
defined as warm even though the address had not been accessed before.


Exploit Scenario
A malicious prover generates a proof of execution for a transaction involving two `CALL`
opcodes to the same address that results in different gas costs from the EVM specification:


Trail of Bits 31 Scroll zkEVM halo2 Circuits Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


in the first `CALL` opcode execution, the prover sets the address as cold instead of warm,
causing the wrong gas calculation for the second call. The prover submits that proof, the
results of which will not match the correct EVM semantics, leading to state divergence and
loss of funds.


Recommendations
Short term, add constraints to ensure that the callee address becomes warm on the `CALL`
opcodes, by constraining `is_warm` to be true.

The zkEVM circuit enforces correct memory operation results for EVM opcodes by
performing lookups into this table, as shown in figure 8.2. Calls such as `memory_lookup`

However, these lookups enforce only the _existence_ of such rows, and for correct execution,
it is vital that the reads and writes present in the table are the following:


  - Coherent with the external state: The first read of any data is correctly initialized,
and the last write of externally visible data (e.g., storage) is reflected in the Ethereum
state commitment.


  - Coherent with each other: Values in read operations match the most recent written
value or the initial value.


  - Coherent with the execution trace: Every entry in the RW table corresponds to
exactly one memory-access-generating step in the execution trace. Equivalently,
there are no “extra” entries in the table.


These global constraints on the RW table are enforced through three major checks.


First, the RW table is lexicographically ordered with respect to its columns. Several
constraints are used to enforce lexicographic ordering. An illustrative example is shown in
figure 8.5. Note that the constraint is conditional on the fixed column `selector` . All other
lexicographic ordering constraints are also conditional on this fixed column, so any rows
where `selector == 0` are not required to be ordered.

```
 meta.create_gate("limb_difference is not zero", |meta| {
   let selector = meta.query_fixed(selector, Rotation::cur());
   let limb_difference = meta.query_advice(limb_difference, Rotation::cur());
   let limb_difference_inverse =
     meta.query_advice(limb_difference_inverse, Rotation::cur());
   vec![ selector * (1.expr() - limb_difference * limb_difference_inverse)]
 });
```

Second, a large collection of structural properties on the sorted table are enforced. Figures
8.6 and 8.7 show examples of such constraints. When the rows are sorted, all operations
involving the same address or storage identifier are grouped together, sorted in increasing
order by the final two columns, which represent the value `rw_counter` in big-endian. Note
that increasing values of `rw_counter` are treated as “happening later in time,” as shown in
the highlighted portion of figure 8.6, which enforces that reads do not change the value by
requiring that `value == value_prev` in read entries.


Trail of Bits 35 Scroll zkEVM halo2 Circuits Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


Unlike in other parts of the table, the constraints applied to `Start` rows (illustrated in
figure 8.7) use the `rw_counter` fields for a different purpose. Every `Start` row where
`lexicographic_ordering_selector == 1` is required to exactly increase `rw_counter`
by `1` . `Start` rows do not represent memory operations, and thus can be thought of as
padding.

```
 // When all the keys in the current row and previous row are equal.
 self.condition(q.not_first_access.clone(), |cb| {

```

```
cb.require_zero(

```

```
  "non-first access reads don't change value",
  q.is_read() * (q.rw_table.value.clone() - q.rw_table.value_prev.clone()),

Third, a running count of RW lookups is tracked in the `rw_counter` field of `StepState`
(shown in figure 8.8) for each step. When execution reaches the `EndBlock` state, two
additional lookups are performed, shown in figure 8.9. These lookups ensure that there are
`max_rws - step.rw_counter` padding rows in the RW table, and are designed to check
that there are at most `step.rw_counter` non-padding rows in the table.

```
 pub(crate) struct StepState<F> {
   /// The execution state selector for the step

These checks are sufficient to guarantee RW table correctness, assuming the following:


1. The `rw_counter` field of `StepState` correctly tracks how many _distinct, non-Start_
RW lookups are performed in the execution trace.


2. `lexicographic_ordering_selector == 1` whenever `rw_table.q_enable == 1` .


3. `rw_table.q_enable` is a sequence of all `1` s followed by all `0` s.


4. There are at most `max_rws` rows where `rw_table.q_enable == 1` .


If any of these requirements is false, a malicious prover can prove erroneous execution
traces by manipulating the RW table in some way:


1. If the `rw_counter` overcounts the number of distinct RW lookups, a row
representing a malicious memory write can be inserted.


2. If `lexicographic_ordering_selector == 0` in any cell where
`rw_table.q_enable == 1`, the prover may bypass nearly all structural property
checks by partitioning the RW table into two “versions,” one starting at the beginning
of the table and one starting at that unrestricted row.


3. If `rw_table.q_enable` is `1`, then `0`, then `1`, the middle row will not correspond to
any RW lookup, and thus may be set to a malicious memory write.


4. If `rw_table.q_enable` is `1` for more than than `max_rws` rows, a malicious memory
write can be inserted.


These four assumptions are all properties of fixed rows, constants, or the circuit itself, so
they do not need to be constrained in the circuit. However, they are not currently explicitly
enforced at circuit-construction time, so if any of them is violated when generating the
zkEVM verification key, this will go undetected and would lead to global circuit
unsoundness.

Unfortunately, the first is equivalent to “there are no `rw_counter` -related bugs in the EVM
circuit,” so it is difficult to enforce. However, the relationships between
`lexicographic_ordering_selector`, `rw_table.q_enable`, and `max_rws` can and
should be checked automatically with assertions.


Exploit Scenario
An incorrect version of the zkEVM circuit is used to generate a verification key that fails to
enforce one of the assumptions above. A malicious prover then crafts an RW table that
leads to incorrect execution of a transaction, causing state divergence and potential loss of
funds.


Recommendations
Short term, add `assert!(...)` calls to enforce correct correspondence between
`rw_table.q_enable`, `lexicographic_ordering_selector`, and `max_rws` .


Long term, review and document assumptions made about all circuit constants. When
possible, use techniques such as assertions to check these assumptions at
circuit-construction time.

9. The CREATE and CREATE2 opcodes can be called within a static context


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-9


Target: z `kevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/execution/create.rs`


Description
The `CREATE` and `CREATE2` opcodes are missing a constraint that prevents them from being
called in the context of a static call. This allows for a state-changing operation that is not
allowed by the EVM specification.


In the context of a `STATICCALL`, the state cannot be modified. As a result, state-changing
opcodes like `CREATE`, `CREATE2`, `LOGX`, `SSTORE`, and `CALL` are forbidden when the argument
value differs from 0, according to the EVM specification. However, the current
implementation of the `CREATE` and `CREATE2` opcodes does not have a check to ensure that
the calling context has permission to change the state. By contrast, the other
implementations of state-changing opcodes have the following check:

```
 // constrain not in static call
 let is_static = cb.call_context(None, CallContextFieldTag::IsStatic);
 cb.require_zero("is_static is false", is_static.expr());
```

_Figure 9.1:_ _`[zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/execution/sstore.rs#L57-L59](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e8bcb23e1f303bd6e0dc52924b0ed85710b8a016/zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/execution/sstore.rs#L57-L59)`_


Without this validation in place, a malicious prover could generate a proof of execution for
a transaction involving the `CREATE` opcode within the context of a `STATICCALL`, leading to
state divergence.


Note that the `SELFDESTRUCT` opcode is disabled, but is also subject to the non-static
constraint according to the Ethereum Yellow Paper. This should be taken into account if the
opcode is implemented in the future.


Exploit Scenario
Alice deploys a constant-function automated market maker (AMM) smart contract `AliceMM`
to the Scroll zkEVM. In each AMM transaction, `AliceMM` receives funds in token type A (or
B), then calculates the exchange rate, then sends funds in token type B (or A). To calculate
the exchange rate, `AliceMM` calls Bob’s `ComplicatedMath` contract. Alice knows about
reentrancy attacks and is careful to call `ComplicatedMath` only with `STATICCALL` .
However, Bob has deployed a malicious version of `ComplicatedMath` that uses `CREATE` to
call `AliceMM` in a reentrant fashion. Bob calls `AliceMM` with a malicious transaction that

manipulates the exchange rate, then drains the contract of token A in exchange for a tiny
amount of token B, resulting in loss of funds.


Recommendations
Short term, add the constraint to validate that the execution context does not allow
state-changing operations.


Long term, add tests for the `CREATE`, `CREATE2`, `LOGX`, `SSTORE`, and `CALL` opcodes when
called within a `STATICCALL` .

10. ResponsibleOpcode table incorrectly handles CREATE and CREATE2


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-10


Target: z `kevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/step.rs`


Description
The `ResponsibleOpcode` table is used to attribute different execution states to particular
sets of opcodes. For many opcodes, this table is the primary source of truth for which state
they transition to. The `SameContextGadget` (shown in figure 10.1) enforces that executing
opcodes correctly use the corresponding state. For example, it enforces that the `ADD`
opcode uses the `ADD_SUB` state.


```
cb.add_lookup(

```

```
"Responsible opcode lookup",
Lookup::Fixed {

```

```
tag: FixedTableTag::ResponsibleOpcode.expr(),
values: [

       cb.execution_state().as_u64().expr(),
       opcode.expr(),
       0.expr(),
     ],
  },
);

```

This table is populated via the `ExecutionState::responsible_opcodes` method, which
also is used for reporting execution statistics. This method does not handle the `CREATE2`
state, and incorrectly reports both `CREATE` and `CREATE2` as the responsible opcodes for
the `CREATE` state, as shown in figure 10.2:

```
 Self::CREATE => vec![OpcodeId::CREATE, OpcodeId::CREATE2],
```

_Figure 10.2:_ _`[zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/step.rs#304](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e8bcb23e1f303bd6e0dc52924b0ed85710b8a016/zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/step.rs#L304)`_


Since the `CREATE` and `CREATE2` opcodes constrain the execution state in a way that does
not use `SameContextGadget`, this does not cause any soundness issues. However, if a
similar error were made for another opcode or state in the table, the resulting circuit may
be either incomplete or underconstrained.

Description
The Fiat-Shamir code in the `snark-verifier` patch does not incorporate the elliptic curve

any instances where the curve parameters are explicitly added to a Fiat-Shamir transcript.

Non-interactive proofs must commit exactly to the statement being proven before any
challenges are generated. If a prover can equivocate about attributes of the statement (e.g.,
which elliptic curve the points are supposed to be on), a proof for one statement may be
[passed off as a proof for another, as in the Frozen Heart class of vulnerabilities. (Note that](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/04/13/part-1-coordinated-disclosure-of-vulnerabilities-affecting-girault-bulletproofs-and-plonk/)
the Frozen Heart PlonK vulnerability discussed in the linked article is not under
consideration here; it is only an illustration of Fiat-Shamir vulnerabilities.)


The `snark-verifier` code is intended to be curve-agnostic, so a proof generated using
one curve may be verified using a different elliptic curve that shares only the points present
in the transcript, leading to identical challenge values but a different statement.


In general, two different elliptic curves can share only a limited number of points, so the
<u>existing code may implicitly commit to the curve being used. However, we have not</u>

determined the exact threshold, and a detailed security proof should be done if that
property is relied upon.


In the Scroll zkEVM system, the prover and verifier use a fixed set of curve parameters, so it
is not possible to convince Scroll software to accept a proof using another curve.


Recommendations
Short term, include the curve parameters at the beginning of the Fiat-Shamir transcript.


Long term, always consider including all public parameters of the system in the Fiat-Shamir
transformations.

12. The gas cost for the CALL opcode is underconstrained


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-12


Target: z `kevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/execution/callop.rs`


Description
The gas cost of the `CALL` -like opcodes ( `CALL`, `CALLCODE`, `DELEGATECALL`, and `STATICCALL` )
is not constrained, allowing a malicious prover to spend as much gas as desired in certain
conditions. This allows free gas `CALL` operations if the prover sets this value to zero, or it
can cause the transaction execution to terminate after the execution of the current opcode
by defining a high gas cost. Both options could cause a state divergence from an execution
following the EVM specification.


Figure 12.1 shows the code that gets the witness cell `step_gas_cost` and then uses it
unconstrained to set the gas cost of the current opcode. This happens when the call
precheck conditions are valid (i.e., the call depth is valid, and the caller balance is enough to
transfer the call value), and the called address has no associated code:

A malicious prover generates and submits a proof of execution for a transaction involving a
`CALL` to an address with empty code that would normally exhaust the transaction’s gas. By
defining the gas cost as zero, the transaction succeeds. However, this execution does not
match the correct EVM semantics, leading to state divergence and loss of funds.

prover-generated execution trace. This execution trace consists of a series of states, each
represented by a constructor of the `ExecutionState enum` . Each state corresponds to an
“execution gadget” in the circuit, which checks preconditions and enforces correct updates
to EVM data structures such as memory and storage.


In the Scroll codebase, the correspondence between the execution state and opcode is
enforced entirely by these gadgets. Most execution gadgets use a `SameContextGadget`
(shown in figure 13.1) to check that the current `(execution` `state, opcode)` pair
appears in the `ResponsibleOpcode` table. Execution gadgets that do not use
`SameContextGadget` must check that the current opcode is correct for the current state
through other means. For example, `ErrorOOGSloadSstoreGadget`, shown in figure 13.2,
uses a `PairSelectGadget` to enforce that, when the execution state is
`ErrorOutOfGasSloadSstore`, the opcode must be either `SSTORE` or `SLOAD` .

```
 cb.add_lookup(
   "Responsible opcode lookup",
   Lookup::Fixed {
     tag: FixedTableTag::ResponsibleOpcode.expr(),
     values: [

   },
 );

Because checking the opcode/state correspondence is the responsibility of each execution
gadget, if any execution gadget fails to properly constrain the opcode, a malicious prover
can replace another execution step with that gadget’s execution state.


In the simplest case, this can lead to state divergence, but, in general, a malicious prover
may have a large amount of control over the resulting state.


For example, the `ReturnRevertGadget`, shown in figure 13.3, does not enforce that the
opcode is either `RETURN` or `REVERT` . A malicious prover can replace any execution state
with a `RETURN_REVERT` state, causing the execution to halt at an arbitrary point, and
potentially returning data depending on the values currently on the stack and in memory. If
the transaction creates a contract, a malicious prover can replace the code being deployed
with values available in memory at other points in the init code’s execution.

```
 impl<F: Field> ExecutionGadget<F> for ReturnRevertGadget<F> {
   const NAME: &'static str = "RETURN_REVERT";

In total, we found four gadgets that do not constrain the opcode to match the current
execution state:


  - `ErrorCodeStoreGadget` ( `[execution/error_code_store.rs#41–87](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e8bcb23e1f303bd6e0dc52924b0ed85710b8a016/zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/execution/error_code_store.rs#L41-L87)` )


  - `ErrorPrecompileFailedGadget`

    - Additionally, the `ErrorPrecompileFailedGadget` fails to check that the
called address is a precompile contract and is missing a correct transition
enforcement using the `CommonErrorGadget` .


  - `ErrorInvalidCreationCodeGadget`
( `[execution/error_invalid_creation_code.rs#L35-L73](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e8bcb23e1f303bd6e0dc52924b0ed85710b8a016/zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/execution/error_invalid_creation_code.rs#L35-L73)` )


  - `ReturnRevertGadget` ( `[execution/return_revert.rs#L60-L293](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e8bcb23e1f303bd6e0dc52924b0ed85710b8a016/zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/execution/return_revert.rs#L60-L293)` )


Exploit Scenario
Suppose a bridge between two blockchains uses the Scroll zkEVM to bridge assets between
them. Alice crafts a transaction which, when an opcode such as an `ADD` is instead executed
as a `RETURN`, will erroneously withdraw funds from the bridge. She generates a malicious
execution trace and submits a zkEVM proof to the bridge, which allows her to drain the
bridge of funds.


Recommendations
Short term, add the missing opcode checks to `ErrorCodeStoreGadget`,
`ErrorPrecompileFailedGadget`, `ErrorInvalidCreationCodeGadget`, and
`ReturnRevertGadget` .


Long term, consider redesigning the way that opcodes map to states. The current design
means that any execution gadget that fails to constrain the opcode will cause
nondeterministic execution. If, instead, each execution gadget has an `enable` input, and
the EVM circuit deterministically selects which gadget(s) have `enable == 1`, an
underconstrained execution gadget can affect only the behavior of opcodes that are
supposed to use that gadget.

14. Nondeterministic execution of ReturnDataCopyGadget and
ErrorReturnDataOutOfBoundGadget


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-14


Target: `zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/execution/returndatacopy.rs`


Description
The gadget that implements the successful execution of the `RETURNDATACOPY` opcode is
underconstrained, allowing a malicious prover to successfully execute the opcode when it
is in an error condition for particular opcode inputs. This allows the prover to cause state
divergence from a correct EVM execution.


Figure 14.1 shows the error gadget implementation that constrains the trace to have at
least one true error condition for the `RETURNDATACOPY` opcode. These constraints check
overflow conditions on the stack values and their sum.

```
 // Check if `data_offset` is Uint64 overflow.
 let data_offset_larger_u64 = sum::expr(&data_offset.cells[N_BYTES_U64..]);
 let is_data_offset_within_u64 = IsZeroGadget::construct(cb, data_offset_larger_u64);

 // Check if `remainder_end` is Uint64 overflow.
 let sum = AddWordsGadget::construct(cb, [data_offset, size], remainder_end.clone());
 let is_end_u256_overflow = sum.carry().as_ref().unwrap();

 let remainder_end_larger_u64 = sum::expr(&remainder_end.cells[N_BYTES_U64..]);
 let is_remainder_end_within_u64 = IsZeroGadget::construct(cb,
 remainder_end_larger_u64);

 // check if `remainder_end` exceeds return data length.
 let is_remainder_end_exceed_len = LtGadget::construct(
   cb,
   return_data_length.expr(),
   from_bytes::expr(&remainder_end.cells[..N_BYTES_U64]),
 );

```

```
// Need to check if `data_offset + size` is U256 overflow via `AddWordsGadget`

// yes, it should be also an error of return data out of bound.

On the successful execution path, these conditions are not checked to be false. In fact, if
`data_offset = WORD_CELL_MAX`, `size = 0`, and `return_data_size < 2` <sup>`32`</sup>, the
`ReturnDataCopyGadget` constraints are satisfied. This case is an error state because
`data_offset` is larger than `u64::MAX` .

In sum, the prover could decide whether the execution would correctly halt with the
`ErrorReturnDataOutOfBoundGadget` error or if it would successfully execute the
`RETURNDATACOPY` opcode.


Exploit Scenario
A malicious prover generates and submits a proof of execution for a transaction involving a
`RETURNDATACOPY` with particular arguments. Due to the missing validations on the
successful execution state, the prover could choose to successfully execute the opcode, or
halt the execution, leading to state divergence and loss of funds.


Recommendations
Short term, add constraints to ensure that the successful execution state is disjoint from
the error execution state.


Long term, investigate other error states and their associated opcode implementations to
guarantee that their execution state is disjoint and cannot be chosen by a malicious prover.

15. Many RW counter updates are magic numbers


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-15


Target: `zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/execution/`


Description
The zkEVM circuit checks memory read and write operations in a transaction’s execution
trace by performing lookups into the RW table. Within the circuit, updates to the state
variable, which tracks the total number of read/write operations, are frequently specified
with a manual count. That manual process is error-prone and difficult to check, and it can
be replaced with a calculated value in all cases we have seen.


The read-write consistency checks in the zkEVM circuit require the overall block to have a
correct count of the total number of lookups into the RW table. If that count is incorrect, a
malicious prover can insert extraneous write operations into the table and choose an
arbitrary result for any memory read (see TOB-SCROLL-8 for a detailed explanation). Each
execution gadget is individually responsible for creating a `StepStateTransition` that
enforces the correct update of the `rw_counter` field of `StepState` . For example, figure
15.1 shows the `StepStateTransition` for the `AddSubGadget` . There are three RW
lookups caused by the `stack_pop()` calls, and thus the `rw_counter_field` is set to
`Delta(3)`, representing an increase by three.

```
 // ADD: Pop a and b from the stack, push c on the stack
 // SUB: Pop c and b from the stack, push a on the stack
 cb.stack_pop(select::expr(is_sub.expr().0, c.expr(), a.expr()));
 cb.stack_pop(b.expr());
 cb.stack_push(select::expr(is_sub.expr().0, a.expr(), c.expr()));

 // State transition
 let step_state_transition = StepStateTransition {
   rw_counter: Delta(3.expr()),
   program_counter: Delta(1.expr()),
   stack_pointer: Delta(1.expr()),
   gas_left: Delta(-OpcodeId::ADD.constant_gas_cost().expr()),
   ..StepStateTransition::default()
 };
 let same_context = SameContextGadget::construct(cb, opcode, step_state_transition) ;

However, many execution gadgets have much more complicated `rw_counter` updates,
which are difficult to check for correctness.


To illustrate this complexity, consider figures 15.2 and 15.3, which show
`ErrorInvalidOpcodeGadget` and `ErrorWriteProtectionGadget` . Each of them uses
the `CommonErrorGadget`, which has an RW counter delta as the third parameter.
However, `ErrorInvalidOpcodeGadget` does not seem to contain any RW lookups at all,
but provides the value `2`, while `ErrorWriteProtectionGadget` seems to have either one
or four RW lookups depending on the value of `is_call`, yet provides a `0` to
`CommonErrorGadget` .

In `ErrorInvalidOpcodeGadget`, there are in fact two total RW lookups; however,
unintuitively, they occur inside `CommonErrorGadget` itself, as shown in figure 15.4. Thus,
any caller of `CommonErrorGadget` effectively must add two to the value of
`rw_counter_delta` .

The case of `ErrorWriteProtectionGadget` is somewhat more complex but illustrates a
useful alternative to manually counting lookups. `CommonErrorGadget` is called with an
`rw_counter_delta` value of `0` . One might expect that this is incorrect; it should count the
two lookups inside `CommonErrorGadget`, plus one unconditional lookup and three
conditional lookups outside. However, upon closer inspection, `CommonErrorGadget` only
uses `rw_counter_delta` at all when `curr.state.is_root` is true.
`ErrorWriteProtectionGadget` can occur only inside of a static call, and the root call of a
transaction is never a static call—therefore, that case is never active and the value of
`rw_counter_delta` can be set to a dummy value, in this case, `0` . Instead,
`RestoreContextGadget` handles the RW counter update, basing it on a call to
`ConstraintBuilder::rw_counter_offset`, as shown in figure 15.5. Since

`rw_counter_offset` is updated automatically in each call to
`ConstraintBuilder::rw_lookup`, that count is correct by construction.

In general, the process of counting the number of RW lookups in any given gadget is both
subtle and tedious when done manually, but cases that use
`ConstraintBuilder::rw_counter_offset` to determine that offset are effectively
trivial when checking for correctness. `CreateGadget` has very complex logic, including
three different conditional calls to `require_step_state_transition` and a large
number of RW lookups. However, each `StepStateTransition` computes its RW counter
update automatically, as illustrated in figure 15.6.

By contrast, `CallOpGadget` has three different `StepStateTransition` s, each of which

Recommendations
Short term, replace magic-number RW counter updates with computed values, such as
those provided by `ConstraintBuilder::rw_counter_offset` .


Long term, consider redesigning the API for building `StepStateTransition` s. Since all RW
lookups are performed via the `ConstraintBuilder` API, updates to simple counter-style
state variables, such as the stack pointer and the RW counter, can typically be computed
rather than manually specified. If the easy-to-calculate fields are always computed, that
core computation can be checked for correctness; as a result, all uses will be correct by
construction.

16. Native PCS accumulation deciders accept an empty vector


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-16


Target: `snark-verifier/src/pcs/{kzg,` `ipa}/decider.rs`


Description
Both the KZG and IPA native `decide_all` implementations accept an empty vector of
accumulators. This can allow an attacker to bypass verification by submitting an empty
vector.

```
 fn decide_all(
   dk: &Self::DecidingKey,
   accumulators: Vec<IpaAccumulator<C, NativeLoader>>,
 ) -> bool {
   !accumulators

This function contrasts with the EVM loader implementation that asserts that the
accumulator vector is non-empty:

```
 fn decide_all(
   dk: &Self::DecidingKey,
   mut accumulators: Vec<KzgAccumulator<M::G1Affine, Rc<EvmLoader>>>,
 ) -> Result<(), Error> {
   assert!(!accumulators.is_empty());
```

Exploit Scenario
An attacker is able to control the arguments to `decide_all` and passes an empty vector,
causing the verification function to accept an invalid proof.

```

Description
Both the `ErrorOOGSloadSstore` and the `ErrorOOGLog` gadgets do an RW table lookup to
check whether the current call is within a static context. However, the lookup result is not
used in any subsequent constraint, making the lookup redundant.

```
 // constrain not in static call
 let is_static_call = cb.call_context(None, CallContextFieldTag::IsStatic);
 //cb.require_zero("is_static_call is false in LOGN", is_static_call.expr());
```

The commented-out constraint would provide a clear state distinction between the
`ErrorOOGLogGadget` error case and the `ErrorWriteProtectionGadget`, preventing an
attacker from arbitrarily choosing one of the error states at will.


As far as we know, in this case, these two different error execution states do not translate
to diverging EVM states; thus, this finding’s severity is informational.


Recommendations
Short term, decide whether to remove the RW table lookup or to uncomment the
non-static environment constraint in both the `ErrorOOGSloadSstore` and `ErrorOOGLog`
gadgets. Investigate all commented-out constraints and remove them from the codebase,
or enable them if they are necessary.

Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-21


Target: `misc-precompiled-circuit/src/utils/mod.rs`


Description
The `bn_to_field` function converts arbitrary length integers into a field element.
However, if the byte representation of the integers is larger than 64 bytes, the big integer
bytes will be silently truncated. This means that any two integers with the same 512 least
significant bits will lead to the same field element.

```
 pub fn bn_to_field<F: FieldExt>(bn: &BigUint) -> F {
   let mut bytes = bn.to_bytes_le();
   bytes.resize(64, 0);
   F::from_bytes_wide(&bytes.try_into().unwrap())
 }
```

_Figure 21.1:_ _`[src/utils/mod.rs#L10-L15](https://github.com/scroll-tech/misc-precompiled-circuit/blob/05725ec61d52d29a063395b0a1130467bee0d2f1/src/utils/mod.rs#L10-L15)`_


Instead, the function should check whether the big integer fits into the field capacity by
using the `F::capacity` constant. This would guarantee a faithful representation of the big
integer into the field element and a successful reconversion back to the `BigUint` type.


Note that the `from_bytes_wide` function will also reduce the element modulo the field
order so that it is represented as a field element.


Exploit Scenario
An attacker provides two big integers with the same 512 least significant bits to the
`bn_to_field` function, causing it to return the same element. When these elements are
used in future operations, they will lead to the same result, even though they were
different.


Recommendations
Short term, add documentation to the function explaining the intended behavior; add
checks that validate that the big integer is representable in the chosen field.

Description
The implementation of the `field_to_bn` function calls the `to_repr` function on the value
of the input `f` when constructing the little-endian binary representation of the input `f` .

```
 pub fn field_to_bn<F: FieldExt>(f: &F) -> BigUint {
   let bytes = f.to_repr();
   BigUint:: from_bytes_le( bytes.as_ref())
 }
```

[However, according to the documentation of the](https://docs.rs/ff/latest/ff/trait.PrimeField.html#tymethod.to_repr) `PrimeField` trait, the endianness
returned by `PrimeField::to_repr` is implementation-dependent and may be different
depending on the underlying field.

```
 /// Converts an element of the prime field into the standard byte representation for
 /// this field.
 ///
 /// The endianness of the byte representation is implementation-specific. Generic
 /// encodings of field elements should be treated as opaque.
 fn to_repr(&self) -> Self::Repr;
```

_Figure 22.2: The value returned by_ _`to_repr`_ _is implementation-dependent and should be_

_treated as opaque by the user._


Exploit Scenario
The `field_to_bn` function is reused with a scalar field `F` that uses a different internal
representation of the elements of `F` . The resulting big integer might not correspond to the
same field element.

Short term, implement a function that assuredly returns a little-endian representation of
the field element.

23. The values of the bytecode table tag column are not constrained to be
HEADER or BYTE


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-23


Target: `zkevm-circuits/src/bytecode_circuit/circuit.rs`


Description
The bytecode table has a column that indicates the `TAG` of each row. Currently, the `TAG`
cells are assigned only a `HEADER` or a `BYTE` value. However, the circuit does not constrain
the `TAG` value of each row to accept only these values. This missing constraint does not
cause a direct soundness issue because of other indirect constraints and how the bytecode
circuit is implemented, but future code refactorings could cause the issue to become
exploitable.


The bytecode table contains the set of bytecodes that are executed in a block. For each
bytecode, the table contains a `HEADER` row, followed by `BYTE` rows corresponding to each
byte of the bytecode, and a final `HEADER` row.


The circuit imposes constraints for each type of row (e.g., figure 23.1 shows how a `HEADER`
row is constrained to have an index column value of `0` ), and for transitions between two
rows (e.g., transitioning from a `HEADER` row to a `BYTE` row, the length column must stay the
same).

```
 // When is_header ->
 // assert cur.index == 0
 // assert cur.value == cur.length
 meta.create_gate("Header row", |meta| {
   let mut cb = BaseConstraintBuilder::default();

   cb.require_zero(
     "cur.index == 0",
     meta.query_advice(bytecode_table.index, Rotation::cur()),
   );

   cb.require_equal(
     "cur.value == cur.length",
     meta.query_advice(bytecode_table.value, Rotation::cur()),
     meta.query_advice(length, Rotation::cur()),
   );

   cb.gate(and::expr(vec![

```

```
     meta.query_fixed(q_enable, Rotation::cur()),
     not::expr(meta.query_fixed(q_last, Rotation::cur())),
     is_header(meta),
   ]))
 });
```

_Figure 23.1:_ _`[zkevm-circuits/src/bytecode_circuit/circuit.rs#L178-L200](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e8bcb23e1f303bd6e0dc52924b0ed85710b8a016/zkevm-circuits/src/bytecode_circuit/circuit.rs#L178-L200)`_


To check whether a row is a `HEADER` or a `BYTE` row, the implementation performs steps
that rely on particular assumptions:


  - It implicitly assumes that the `enum` value corresponding to `HEADER` is `0` and the one
to `BYTE` is `1` . This assumption can be broken in the future if a developer adds an
extra `enum` field on the `BytecodeFieldTag enum` .


  - It uses Boolean operators `and::expr`, `not::expr` on the bytecode tag values.
These operators must operate only on Boolean values; otherwise, they will return an
unexpected value.


  - It gates the constraints with conjunctions resulting from the `and::expr` operator: if
a lookup is guarded by the conjunction of non-Boolean values, the value that is
looked up will be a scaled version of the intended value.

```
 let is_byte_to_byte = |meta: &mut VirtualCells<F>| {
   and::expr(vec![
     meta.query_advice(bytecode_table.tag, Rotation::cur()),
     meta.query_advice(bytecode_table.tag, Rotation::next()),
   ])
 };

 let is_header = |meta: &mut VirtualCells<F>| {
   not::expr(meta.query_advice(bytecode_table.tag, Rotation::cur()))
 };

 let is_byte =
   |meta: &mut VirtualCells<F>| meta.query_advice(bytecode_table.tag,
 Rotation::cur());
```

_Figure 23.2:_ _`[zkevm-circuits/src/bytecode_circuit/circuit.rs#L125-L137](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e8bcb23e1f303bd6e0dc52924b0ed85710b8a016/zkevm-circuits/src/bytecode_circuit/circuit.rs#L125-L137)`_


The soundness of all these steps and implementation details rely on the bytecode tag value
being Boolean. However, the implementation does not have a constraint validating that the
`TAG` values are, in fact, Boolean.


If a malicious prover were to provide a non-Boolean value, since the `not::expr` and
`and::expr` functions operate under the assumption that their input values are Boolean,
the circuit will have soundness issues.


Trail of Bits 67 Scroll zkEVM halo2 Circuits Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


One avenue of exploitation is on the `push_data_size_table_lookup` on the bytecode
table: this lookup is gated on the `is_byte(meta)` constraint, causing it to be implicitly
scaled to a different lookup if the `is_byte(meta)` result is non-Boolean. This would allow
a malicious prover to obtain the wrong `push_data_size` from the
`push_data_size_table_lookup` table and provide an incorrect bytecode with respect to
the `is_code` column. In other words, the data pushed in a `PUSH*` opcode could be marked
as code, then allowing the EVM execution to follow an execution flow incompatible with
EVM semantics.

```
 meta.lookup_any(
   "push_data_size_table_lookup(cur.value, cur.push_data_size)",
   |meta| {
     let enable = and::expr(vec![
        meta.query_fixed(q_enable, Rotation::cur()),
        not::expr(meta.query_fixed(q_last, Rotation::cur())),
        is_byte(meta),
     ]);

     let lookup_columns = vec![value, push_data_size];

     let mut constraints = vec![];

     for i in 0..PUSH_TABLE_WIDTH {

```

```
constraints.push((

```

```
          enable.clone() * meta.query_advice(lookup_columns[i],
Rotation::cur()),

```

```
          meta.query_fixed(push_table[i], Rotation::cur()),
       ))
     }
     constraints
  },
);

```


_Figure 23.3:_ _`[zkevm-circuits/src/bytecode_circuit/circuit.rs#L220-L241](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e8bcb23e1f303bd6e0dc52924b0ed85710b8a016/zkevm-circuits/src/bytecode_circuit/circuit.rs#L220-L241)`_


However, a row with a non-Boolean `TAG` actually satisfies both the `is_header(meta)` and
`is_byte(meta)` constraints. Thus, for an attacker to be successful, they would have to
satisfy an unsatisfiable set of constraints on the `index` column:


  - `is_header` : requires `cur.index == 0`


  - `is_header_to_byte` : requires `next.index == 0`


  - `is_byte_to_byte` : requires `next.index == cur.index + 1`


There exists another avenue of exploiting the missing constraint that requires the `TAG`
value to equal `BYTE` or `HEADER` . If a malicious prover were able to inject rows in the table
with a different `TAG` value, they would be able to disable the `BYTE-TO-BYTE`,
`BYTE-TO-HEADER`, `HEADER-TO-HEADER`, and `HEADER-TO-BYTE` transition constraints.


Trail of Bits 68 Scroll zkEVM halo2 Circuits Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


As an example, if between two `HEADER` rows there existed a row different from `HEADER` or
`BYTE`, the `HEADER-TO-HEADER` transition gate would always be false. This exploit scenario
is unexploitable for the same reason as the previous exploit. However, while correctly
enforcing the `is_header`, `is_header_to_byte`, `is_byte_to_byte`,
`is_header_to_header`, `is_byte`, and `is_byte_to_header` transition constraints to
accept only the `HEADER` and `BYTE` values would prevent the
`push_data_size_table_lookup` exploit, it would not prevent the row-to-row transition
constraints from being broken. For a complete fix, it is necessary to constrain the `TAG` value
to be one of `HEADER` or `BYTE` .


Exploit Scenario
Anticipating a future addition to the `TAG enum`, a developer decides to reimplement the
`is_header`, `is_byte`, and transition selectors by requiring that the `TAG` cell value equals
the desired enum value. If they omit the check that the `TAG` value must be restricted to the
`enum` ’s value set, a malicious prover would be able to break the transition constraints by
inserting a row with a tag value different from `HEADER` or `BYTE` .


Recommendations
Short term, require that the `TAG` column is Boolean in the constraint system; make the
`BytecodeFieldTag` values explicitly `0` and `1` by defining the `enum` as follows:

```
 pub enum BytecodeFieldTag {
   /// Header field
   Header = 0,
   /// Byte field
   Byte = 1,
 }
```

_Figure 23.4: Explicit_ _`enum`_ _definition_


Document which constraints need to be changed in case the `BytecodeFieldTag enum` is
extended.


Long term, add stricter types to the Boolean functions in `[gadgets/src/util.rs](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e8bcb23e1f303bd6e0dc52924b0ed85710b8a016/gadgets/src/util.rs#L1-L136)` . These
functions, as their documentation states, should operate only on Boolean values. Enforcing
this in the type system would allow cases where this assumption is violated to be found
and would prevent potential soundness issues.

Description
The bytecode table `HEADER` rows have two unconstrained columns, `is_code` and
`field_input`, on the Poseidon bytecode extended columns. The lack of constraints on

malicious prover to exploit a soundness issue if a vulnerability is introduced in the future.

Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-25


Target: `misc-precompiled-circuit/src/circuits/modexp.rs`


Description
The `for` loop within `decompose_limb` requires `bool_limbs` to contain at least `31`
elements to be correctly indexed from `0` to `30` . Furthermore, if `limbsize` is large enough,
then the `truncate` operation does not grow `bool_limbs` to the correct size, as
`to_radix_le` produces a minimal `Vec` without any trailing zeroes.

```

Description
According to EVM specifications, if the modulus is zero, then the result of `mod_exp` is zero

Short term, correctly handle the zero modulus case of `mod_exp` . Add tests to the `mod_exp`
circuit, including some that exercise its edge cases: the zero exponent case and the zero
modulus case.

27. The ConstraintBuilder::condition API is dangerous


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-27


Target: Several files


Description
The `ConstraintBuilder` implements several useful ways of constructing constraints. One
case is when constraints should be added and conditioned by a particular value. If the
value is true, the constraints must be satisfied; otherwise, they do not need to be satisfied.
However, a problem arises if a developer forgets to consider that a new
`ConstraintBuilder` function is called within the context of a `condition` .


All functions in the `ConstraintBuilder` API must consider the case where they are being
called from inside a conditioned scope. If these functions add constraints or change values
irrespective of the condition value, they will lead to unintended results.


As an example, the `opcode_lookup` function updates the `program_counter_offset`
regardless of the current condition value.

```
 pub(crate) fn opcode_lookup(&mut self, opcode: Expression<F>, is_code:
 Expression<F>) {
   self.opcode_lookup_at(
     self.curr.state.program_counter.expr() + self.program_counter_offset.expr(),
     opcode,
     is_code,
   );
   self.program_counter_offset += 1;
 }
```

_Figure 27.1:_ _`[evm_circuit/util/constraint_builder.rs#608–615](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e8bcb23e1f303bd6e0dc52924b0ed85710b8a016/zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/util/constraint_builder.rs#L608-L615)`_


When used in a condition context, the `program_counter_offset` will be incremented
irrespective of the `condition` value:

```
 const NAME: &'static str = "STOP";

 const EXECUTION_STATE: ExecutionState = ExecutionState::STOP;

 fn configure(cb: &mut ConstraintBuilder<F>) -> Self {
   let code_length = cb.query_cell();
   cb.bytecode_length(cb.curr.state.code_hash.expr(), code_length.expr());

```

Trail of Bits 74 Scroll zkEVM halo2 Circuits Security Assessment

```
   let is_within_range =
     LtGadget::construct(cb, cb.curr.state.program_counter.expr(),
 code_length.expr());
   let opcode = cb.query_cell();
   cb.condition(is_within_range.expr(), |cb| {
     cb.opcode_lookup(opcode.expr(), 1.expr());
   });
```

The provided argument to the `ConstraintBuilder::condition` function must also be
ensured to be Boolean. Certain functions assume this, and they would have unexpected
results otherwise:

```
 pub(crate) fn stack_pop(&mut self, value: Expression<F>) {
   self.stack_lookup(false.expr(), self.stack_pointer_offset.clone(), value);
   self.stack_pointer_offset = self.stack_pointer_offset.clone() +
 self.condition_expr();
 }

```

```
pub(crate) fn stack_push(&mut self, value: Expression<F>) {

```

```
  self.stack_pointer_offset = self.stack_pointer_offset.clone() self.condition_expr();

```

```
  self.stack_lookup(true.expr(), self.stack_pointer_offset.expr(), value);
}

```

The `ConstraintBuilder::gate` function is another dangerous pattern that should be
reconsidered and documented. In its current state, the function clones all constraints and
gates them with the provided selector, returning these new gated constraints. It does not
change the current constraints, which might be an interpretation that a new developer
might have about the function. We have not seen incorrect usage of this particular pattern.
One way of at least ensuring that the returning set of constraints is used is by adding the
`#[must_use]` attribute to the function.


Recommendations
Short term, redesign the `ConstraintBuilder` API, especially with respect to the
`condition` function. Add new Rust types to ensure that the condition expression is
Boolean. Add the `#[must_use]` attribute to the `ConstraintBuilder::gate` function.

28. The EXTCODECOPY opcode implementation does not work when the
account address does not exist


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-SCROLL-28


Target: `zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/execution/extcodecopy.rs`


Description
The current implementation of the `EXTCODECOPY` opcode does not consider the case
where the account address does not exist. This is documented in a code comment, so the
Scroll team should be aware of it.

```
 // TODO: If external_address doesn't exist, we will get code_hash = 0. With
 // this value, the bytecode_length lookup will not work, and the copy
 // from code_hash = 0 will not work. We should use EMPTY_HASH when
 // code_hash = 0.

Recommendations
Short term, implement the missing functionality. Add tests to ensure its correctness.


Long term, look for all “TODO” items in the codebase and triage them into an organized
issue tracker. Address these items in terms of priority.

## C. Code Quality Findings

We identified the following code quality issues through manual and automatic code review.


**●** **Use constants instead of hard-coded values.** Instead of 32, use the
`N_BYTES_WORD` constant.

```
     for idx in 0..32 {
        cb.add_lookup(
          "Bitwise lookup",
          Lookup::Fixed {
            tag: tag.clone(),
            values: [
               a.cells[idx].expr(),
               b.cells[idx].expr(),
               c.cells[idx].expr(),
            ],
          },
        );
     }
```

**●** **Use** **`Transition::Same`** **instead of** **`Delta(0.expr())`** **.** The
`require_step_state_transition` function will perform an extra addition when
handling `Delta(0.expr())` . Also, the line referencing that field can be removed,
since the type’s default is `Same` . This issue is present in several files:
```
   zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/execution/{balance.rs,
   calldataload.rs, extcodehash.rs, extcodesize.rs, is_zero.rs,
```

`not.rs}` .

```
     // State transition
     let step_state_transition = StepStateTransition {
       rw_counter: Delta(2.expr()),
       program_counter: Delta(1.expr()),
       stack_pointer: Delta(0.expr()),
```

**●** **Remove the unused function** **`generate_lagrange_base_polynomial`** **.** The
function is present at
`zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/util/math_gadget.rs` but it is not used in
the codebase.


  - **Add extra checks when doing arithmetic on the opcode.** Several gadgets do
arithmetic on the opcode to extract a relevant value when multiple related opcodes
are adjacent in value. This pattern is error-prone, and the gadgets do not add checks

to ensure the opcode is in the correct range. Extra checks should be included to
prevent misuse, and these operations should be factored out into a common
module to aid readability.

**●** **The following comment is incorrect.** The `SSTORE` gas refund constraints have
code comments describing each constraint. However, the comment for the
`delete_slot` case is wrong:

```
   // (value_prev != value) && ( original_value != value) && (value ==
   // Word::from(0))
   let delete_slot =
      not::expr(prev_eq_value.clone()) * not::expr(original_is_zero.clone()) *
   value_is_zero;
```

**●** **The blanket match case in** **`require_step_state_transition`** **could lead to**
**under-constrained transitions.** The `Transition::Any` case of
`require_step_state_transition` is handled implicitly by a blanket match. If any
new case is added to the `Transition enum`, the default behavior will be to leave
that field unconstrained. If, instead, `Transition::Any` is explicitly handled, the
Rust compiler will generate an incomplete match error.

**●** **Unify the constraint builder APIs.** There are several repeated functions in the
`ConstraintBuilder` and `BaseConstraintBuilder` APIs in
`[util/constraint_builder.rs](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/e8bcb23e1f303bd6e0dc52924b0ed85710b8a016/zkevm-circuits/src/evm_circuit/util/constraint_builder.rs)` .


**●** **There are functionally identical functions.** The
`get_num_rows_required_no_padding` and `get_min_num_rows_required`
functions compute the same number of rows in a slightly different way.

       num_rows += step.execution_state.get_step_height();

**●** **Consider renaming the** **`offset_add`** **function to** **`set_offset`** **.** The `offset_add`

## D. Automated Analysis Tool Confgurationi

As part of this assessment, we used the tools described below to perform automated
testing of the codebase.


D.1. Semgrep

[We used the static analyzer Semgrep to search for risky API patterns and weaknesses in the](https://semgrep.dev/)
source code repository. For this purpose, we wrote rules specifically targeting the
`ConstraintBuilder` APIs and the `ExecutionGadget` trait.

```
 semgrep --metrics=off --sarif --config=custom_rule_path.yml
```

_Figure D.1: The invocation command used to run Semgrep for each custom rule_


Improper Opcode Enforcement Rule
The `ExecutionGadget::configure` implementations must check that the opcode being
executed matches the execution state the machine is in. By using the
`SameContextGadget`, the implementation implicitly enforces the correct opcode to
execution state constraint.


The following Semgrep rule finds `configure` functions that do not properly enforce
opcode constraints by filtering the most common ways that this is validated. It results in 12
findings, some of which are the true positive issues reported in finding TOB-SCROLL-13, as
well as some false positive results that can be dismissed.

## E. Fix Review Results

When undertaking a fix review, Trail of Bits reviews the fixes implemented for issues
identified in the original report. This work involves a review of specific areas of the source
code and system configuration, not comprehensive analysis of the system.


From September 25 to October 2, 2023, Trail of Bits reviewed the fixes and mitigations
implemented by the Scroll team for the issues identified in this report. We reviewed each
fix to determine its effectiveness in resolving the associated issue.


Scroll provided PRs with fixes for all high-severity, medium-severity, and low-severity
findings except for the low-severity finding TOB-SCROLL-21. Scroll also provided PRs with
fixes for several of the informational-severity findings.


In summary, of the 29 issues described in this report, Scroll has resolved 16 issues and has
partially resolved four issues. Scroll has indicated that it does not intend to address two
issues, which have been labeled as unresolved. No fix PRs were provided for the remaining
six issues, so their fix statuses are undetermined. For additional information, please see

#### Detailed Fix Review Results

**TOB-SCROLL-1: The ModGadget is underconstrained and allows incorrect MULMOD**
**operations to be proven**
[Resolved in PR #512. The constraints for](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/512) `a_or_zero` have been replaced with a `select` call
that correctly forces `a_or_zero` to be `0` when `n` is `0` .


**TOB-SCROLL-2: The RlpU64Gadget is underconstrained when is_lt_128 is false**
[Resolved in PR #615. The new constraints force](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/615) `is_lt_128` to be `1` in the case of a zero
value. If `is_lt_128` is `1`, the circuit range-checks the original value. If `is_lt_128` is `0`, the
circuit range-checks a value `v`, defined as follows: if `byte[0]` is the most significant byte, `v`
equals `byte[0]-128`, and if not, `v` equals `0` . If `byte[0]` is the most significant byte, this
suffices to check that `byte[0]` is in the range `[128,256)` . If `byte[0]` is not the most
significant byte, other logic forces there to be a non-zero limb after the first one, which
means `value == 256*x + y` for some `x > 0`, `y >= 0` . Thus, `is_lt_128` is `1` only if `value` is in

`[0,128)` .


**TOB-SCROLL-3: The BLOCKHASH opcode is underconstrained and allows the hash of**
**any block to be computed**
[Resolved in PR #512. The commented-out lookup for](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/512) `current_block_number` has been
uncommented. The Scroll team should evaluate whether it is better to perform this lookup
or to instead directly constrain `current_block_number` to equal
`cb.curr.state.block_number` .


**TOB-SCROLL-4: zkevm-circuits crate depends on an outdated version of halo2-ecc**
[Partially Resolved as of commit 7fe99fe4e3de14801f4d66f75bd35307de39b0a8 in](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/7fe99fe4e3de14801f4d66f75bd35307de39b0a8/zkevm-circuits/Cargo.toml#L38-L39)
`zkevm-circuits` and commit `[70588177930400361c731659b15b2ab3f29f7784](https://github.com/scroll-tech/halo2-lib/tree/70588177930400361c731659b15b2ab3f29f7784)` in
`halo2-lib` . The `zkevm-circuits` now crate depends on the `v0.1.5` tag of the
`scroll-tech/halo2-lib` repository, which includes a fix for the ECDSA implementation.
However, we recommend at least updating to the upstream version 0.3.0, which includes
[many changes, including a different implementation of the](https://github.com/axiom-crypto/halo2-lib/blob/4060f2a703ca5ca3ed03fd869cfdf0c778aae240/halo2-ecc/src/ecc/mod.rs#L492-L507) `scalar_multiply` function
[used by the ECDSA implementation.](https://github.com/axiom-crypto/halo2-lib/blob/4060f2a703ca5ca3ed03fd869cfdf0c778aae240/halo2-ecc/src/ecc/mod.rs#L492-L507)


The updated commit for `halo2-lib` contains all upstream changes we highlighted, but
does not seem to be up to date with the upstream version of the library. Note that we did
not perform a full security assessment of this commit, so we do not know which issues may
still be present in it.


**TOB-SCROLL-5: N_BYTES parameters are not checked to prevent overflow**
[Partially resolved in PR #512.](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/512) `assert!()` calls have been added to constrain the `N_BYTES`
parameter. The expression in `constant_division.rs`, shown in figure E.1, may overflow
when compiled without overflow checks and may incorrectly allow extremely large values
of `N_BYTES` . Note that the `zkevm-circuits` repository configures its release build to
enable overflow checks.

```
 assert!(N_BYTES * 8 + 64 - denominator.leading_zeros() as usize <=
 MAX_N_BYTES_INTEGER * 8);

```

_Figure E.1: The expression that may overflow when compiled without overflow checks_


**TOB-SCROLL-6: Differences in shared code between zkevm-circuits and halo2-lib**
[Resolved in PR #709 and PR #1001. Various](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/709) `debug_assert!()` calls have been replaced
with `assert!()` calls, and the incorrect `log2_ceil` function has been fixed.


**TOB-SCROLL-7: Underconstrained warm status on CALL opcodes allows gas cost**
**forgery**
[Resolved in PR #512, with some additional fixes added in PR #676. PR #512 adds a](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/512)
constraint to `CallOpGadget` forcing `is_warm` to be true, but the initial value of `is_warm` is
not directly constrained. The initial value for all access list reads is false, as highlighted in
figure E.2, while the Ethereum Yellow Paper states that it should be true for precompile
addresses, as shown in figure E.3:

```
 fn build_tx_access_list_account_constraints(&mut self, q: &Queries<F>) {
   self.require_zero("field_tag is 0 for TxAccessListAccount", q.field_tag());
   self.require_zero(
     "storage_key is 0 for TxAccessListAccount",
     q.rw_table.storage_key.clone(),
   );
   self.require_boolean("TxAccessListAccount value is boolean", q.value());
   self.require_zero(
     "initial TxAccessListAccount value is false",
     q.initial_value(),
   );

   self.require_equal(
     "state_root is unchanged for TxAccessListAccount",
     q.state_root(),
     q.state_root_prev(),
   );

   self.condition(q.not_first_access.clone(), |cb| {
     cb.require_equal(
        "value column at Rotation::prev() equals value_prev at Rotation::cur()",
        q.rw_table.value_prev.clone(),
        q.value_prev_column(),
     );
   });
 }

_[Figure E.3: An excerpt from the Ethereum Yellow Paper specifying the initial access list](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf)_


The initial precompile access values have been fixed in PR #676 by adding an access list
write for each precompile to the `BeginTx` state.


**TOB-SCROLL-8: RW table constants must match exactly when the verification key is**
**created**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-SCROLL-9: The CREATE and CREATE2 opcodes can be called within a static**
**context**
[Resolved in PR #512. The](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/512) `CreateGadget::configure` method now performs a
`call_context` lookup to retrieve the `IsStatic` field and then constrains that result to be
zero.


**TOB-SCROLL-10: ResponsibleOpcode table incorrectly handles CREATE and CREATE2**
[Resolved in PR #512. The responsible-opcode table has been updated to map](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/512)
`ExecutionState::CREATE` to `OpcodeId::CREATE` and `ExecutionState::CREATE2` to
`OpcodeId::CREATE2` .


**TOB-SCROLL-11: Elliptic curve parameters omitted from Fiat-Shamir**
Unresolved. The Scroll team has indicated that it does not intend to fix this issue.


**TOB-SCROLL-12: The gas cost for the CALL opcode is underconstrained**
[Resolved in PR #774. Previously, when calling an empty address or a precompile, the](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/774)
unconstrained cell `step_gas_cost` was used to determine the gas cost of the `CALL`
opcode. Now, in all cases, the `gas_left` field of `StepStateTransition` values is derived
from the fully constrained cells `callee_gas_left`, `gas_cost`, and
`call_gadget.has_value` . We did not evaluate whether the overall gas calculation is
_correct_ in this fix review, but it is constrained.


**TOB-SCROLL-13: Unconstrained opcodes allow nondeterministic execution**
[Partially resolved in PR #633 and PR #736. In PR #633, all mentioned gadgets now constrain](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/633)
the opcode. Scroll should inspect and test `ErrorPrecompileFailed` as development


Trail of Bits 96 Scroll zkEVM halo2 Circuits Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


continues to ensure that only _precompile_ calls can trigger it and only when they fail. PR
#736 adds constraints to the `ReturnRevertGadget` component to ensure that `REVERT`
opcodes are accompanied by a reversion in the RW table. We were not able to determine
from these diffs whether it is possible to have a reversion while executing a `RETURN`
opcode. Scroll should inspect and test this component to ensure that a malicious prover
cannot manipulate the behavior of the `RETURN` opcode.


**TOB-SCROLL-14: Nondeterministic execution of ReturnDataCopyGadget and**
**ErrorReturnDataOutOfBoundGadget**
[Resolved in PR #661. The overflow-related validation logic of](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/661) `ReturnDataCopyGadget` and
`ErrorReturnDataOutOfBoundGadget` has been factored out into a common component,
`CommonReturnDataCopyGadget` . This common gadget forces the validation to succeed or
fail based on the `is_overflow` parameter. Note that `is_overflow` is set to `1.expr()` in
one case and `false.expr()` in the other. While these expressions do behave correctly, we
recommend that the Scroll team make these symmetrical; that is, either `1.expr()` and

[Resolved in PR #15. A test has been added to confirm that the data representation matches](https://github.com/scroll-tech/misc-precompiled-circuit/pull/15)
the expectations of the implementation. Scroll should ensure that this test runs before any
deployment.


**TOB-SCROLL-23: The values of the bytecode table tag column are not constrained to**
**be HEADER or BYTE**
[Resolved in PR #681. A Boolean constraint has been added to the](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/681) `tag` column.


**TOB-SCROLL-24: Unconstrained columns on the bytecode HEADER rows**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-SCROLL-25: decompose_limb does not work as intended**
Resolved as of commit `[483feb2e4554fcab58878d7c8e6a6f8be792e2f2](https://github.com/scroll-tech/misc-precompiled-circuit/blob/483feb2e4554fcab58878d7c8e6a6f8be792e2f2/src/circuits/mod.rs#L146-L256)` . The
`decompose_limb` method has been more completely implemented and appears to now
iterate correctly through the limbs. We did not fully review the correctness of this
implementation, and there do not appear to be any direct tests for this implementation.
Scroll should add tests to ensure its correct behavior.


**TOB-SCROLL-26: Zero modulus will cause a panic**
[Partially resolved in PR #4, then fully resolved in PR #12. The](https://github.com/scroll-tech/misc-precompiled-circuit/pull/4) `mod_mult` method has been
modified to use the `number_is_zero` method to return `0` when the `modulus` parameter is
`0` . However, the original fix to the `number_is_zero` method, shown in figure E.4,
introduces a new error by incorrectly checking `number.limbs[0]` three times.

```
 // return 0 if not zero, 1 if zero for number
 pub fn number_is_zero(
   &self,
   region: &mut Region<F>,
   range_check_chip: &mut RangeCheckChip<F>,
   offset: &mut usize,
   number: &Number<F>,
 ) -> Result<Limb<F>, Error> {
   let zero = F::zero();
   let three = F::from(3u64);
   // limb0_zero is 0 if not zero, 1 if zero
   let limb0_zero =
     self.config
        .eq_constant(region, range_check_chip, offset, &number.limbs[0],
 &zero)?;
   let limb1_zero =
     self.config
        .eq_constant(region, range_check_chip, offset, & number.limbs[0],
 &zero)?;
   let limb2_zero =

[The Scroll team has fixed this newly introduced issue in PR #12, and this prevents a zero](https://github.com/scroll-tech/misc-precompiled-circuit/pull/12)
modulus causing a panic by replacing it with the value 1 when dividing.


Although this particular issue has been resolved, the Scroll team should inspect and test
this component carefully, as it has had several correctness problems.


In particular, we recommend that Scroll investigate whether these methods behave
correctly in the presence of malformed values of the `Number` type. The `Number` type, shown
in figure E.5, appears to contain a “CRT-style” representation of a large number, similar to
the `CRTInteger` type in `halo2-ecc` . The first three entries of its `limbs` array contain the
“truncation” part, and the fourth entry contains the “native” part. This representation is not
documented in the code, and we have not determined whether it is possible to create a
malformed `Number` value within the `modexp` circuit.

 pub struct Number<F: FieldExt> {
   limbs: [Limb<F>; 4],
 }

**TOB-SCROLL-27: The ConstraintBuilder::condition API is dangerous**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-SCROLL-28: The EXTCODECOPY opcode implementation does not work when the**
**account address does not exist**
[Resolved in PR #846. Conditional constraints have been added to explicitly handle accounts](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/pull/846)
with no code, as indicated by a zero value in their `CodeHash` field. When an account has no
code, the code size is forced to be zero, and when an account has code, the code size is
determined by a `bytecode_lookup` . We did not find any tests for this behavior. We
recommend that the Scroll team add tests to ensure that this behavior is correct and
remains correct during ongoing development.
