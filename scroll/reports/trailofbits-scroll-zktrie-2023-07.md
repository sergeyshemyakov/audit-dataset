#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Scroll engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of zkTrie. The project is a Go
implementation of a Merkle-Patricia tree, along with Rust bindings.


A team of three consultants conducted the review from June 26 to July 11, 2023, for a total
of four engineer-weeks of effort. Our testing efforts focused on checking for inclusion and
non-inclusion proof verification, data structure correctness, and safe and reliable bindings.
With full access to the source code and documentation, we performed static and dynamic
testing of the codebase, using automated and manual processes.

#### Observations and Impact

We identified several high-severity findings that undermine the assumptions of the Merkle
tree data structure. Flaws in domain separation and the way that the nodes and leaves are
hashed allow an attacker to convince a verifier that a key is simultaneously present in the
tree and not present in the tree (TOB-ZKTRIE-1). The hashing scheme also allows an
attacker to easily create different leaves with the same hash (TOB-ZKTRIE-5) and leaves with
different “canonical values” but the same hash (TOB-ZKTRIE-7). An unchecked cast in the
Rust bindings also allows an attacker to generate nodes from different byte arrays that
would have the same hash (TOB-ZKTRIE-19).


We found several denial-of-service attack vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to
crash the proof verifier with malformed proofs (TOB-ZKTRIE-2) and to cause crashes from
the Rust bindings by triggering a mishandling of Cgo handles (TOB-ZKTRIE-12) and by
providing maliciously chosen data arrays (TOB-ZKTRIE-19).


We found two cases of vulnerable unsafe Rust code: a data race that can be triggered
through a safe Rust interface (TOB-ZKTRIE-16) and an out-of-bounds read (TOB-ZKTRIE-18).


We also found several general software quality problems. In addition to the code quality
findings listed in appendix C, we found duplicated functionality (TOB-ZKTRIE-3), an empty
function implementation (TOB-ZKTRIE-6), and an unused argument in a core function
(TOB-ZKTRIE-9).

#### Recommendations

Based on the codebase maturity evaluation and findings identified during the security
review, Trail of Bits recommends that Scroll take the following steps:


  - **Remediate the findings disclosed in this report.** These findings should be
addressed as part of a direct remediation or as part of any refactor that may occur
when addressing other recommendations.


Trail of Bits 5 Scroll zkTrie Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


  - **Clearly define the library interface and clean up the current implementation.**
The Rust and Go APIs should be fully documented and should match where
appropriate. Redundant functionality should be removed.


  - **Explicitly specify the security guarantees and requirements of the Merkle tree.**
The Merkle proof format and verification algorithm should be explicitly specified. If
possible, security proofs should be written to confirm that Merkle proof verification
is sound based only on the collision resistance of the underlying hash function.


**●** **Add extensive data structure and API testing.** All functions should have
associated positive and negative tests, covering all return paths. Publicly exposed
functions should also be fuzz tested. Add static analysis tools like golangci-lint and
Semgrep to the CI/CD pipeline.


The following tables provide the number of findings by severity and category.

## Project Goals

The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of the Scroll zkTrie.
Specifically, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list of questions:


  - Does the codebase follow best practices for Go and Rust?


  - Is the zkTrie implementation sound and complete? That is, does the implementation
correctly reject invalid inclusion and non-inclusion proofs in the Merkle tree and
correctly accept valid proofs?


  - Does the zkTrie implementation correctly handle malformed or malicious inputs?


  - Are the Rust bindings to the Go implementation safe? Do the safe-Rust interfaces
provide the guarantees required by the Rust type system?

## Project Coverage

This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by
our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:


**●** **Tree implementation:** We manually reviewed the implementation of the Merkle
tree, focusing on inclusion and non-inclusion proof generation and verification as
well as the hash function usage and correct domain separation. We used test
coverage tools to identify areas of code that are not currently being tested; used
several static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities; and wrote several
tests, including a fuzz test for the proof verification routine and a functional
randomized test for the Merkle tree functionality.


**●** **`lib.go`** **and** **`lib.rs`** **:** We manually reviewed the Go implementation, including
functions exposed to C through `cgo`, taking into consideration the correct handling
of the `cgo` handles. We manually reviewed the Rust bindings, focusing on unsafe
code, correct data handling from publicly exposed functions, and their interaction
with the Go library. We used several static analysis tools to identify potential
vulnerabilities and wrote proof-of-concept tests for the findings in this report. These
tests are included in this report and should be incorporated into Scroll’s testing
suite.

## Codebase Maturity Evaluation

Trail of Bits uses a traffic-light protocol to provide each client with a clear understanding of
the areas in which its codebase is mature, immature, or underdeveloped. Deficiencies
identified here often stem from root causes within the software development life cycle that
should be addressed through standardization measures (e.g., the use of common libraries,
functions, or frameworks) or training and awareness programs.


**Category** **Summary** **Result**



Arithmetic We found one high-severity issue related to integer
casting, TOB-ZKTRIE-19, that allows an attacker to create
nodes from different byte arrays that hash to the same
value. The same issue also allows an attacker to crash the
program.

Management



The code is fairly well structured and separated into files
with related functions grouped together. However, the
control flow in some cases is complex and spread across
several files. For example, the Rust `ZkTrie::prove`
method calls `TrieProve` through `cgo`, which calls
`ZkTrie.Prove`, which then calls a callback defined in
`TrieProve`, which calls a C function that calls a Rust
callback.


We found that the codebase has redundant
representations of nodes and different incompatible
ways to generate proofs (TOB-ZKTRIE-3).


The data model differs between the Rust and Go APIs: in
Rust, the data model closely matches the specification
document, while in Go, the zkTrie has a more generic
key-value store API. This API mismatch led to a type
confusion vulnerability (TOB-ZKTRIE-18).


We found two high-severity issues related to the misuse
of hash functions in the context of Merkle trees
(TOB-ZKTRIE-1, TOB-ZKTRIE-5) that allows an attacker to
create proof forgeries.



Data Handling We identified many findings related to unexpected or
malicious inputs (TOB-ZKTRIE-2, TOB-ZKTRIE-10,



Trail of Bits 13 Scroll zkTrie Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


TOB-ZKTRIE-11, TOB-ZKTRIE-12, and TOB-ZKTRIE-19) that
allow an attacker to crash the program. We also found
that other externally facing functions do not validate
their inputs (TOB-ZKTRIE-14).


Documentation The codebase includes a specification document that
describes some data schema and a prose description of
the insertion and deletion algorithms.


However, several parts of the code, including the Rust
API and the database API, are not documented. All
functions should be documented, along with the roles of
their arguments and potential function requirements.
This is of particular importance for the public API
functions in both the Go and Rust libraries.



Memory Safety
and Error
Handling


Testing and
Verification



We found memory safety issues in the `cgo` interface
related to concurrency (TOB-ZKTRIE-12, TOB-ZKTRIE-15,
TOB-ZKTRIE-16, and TOB-ZKTRIE-18).
We also found inconsistent error handling and
propagation (TOB-ZKTRIE-2, TOB-ZKTRIE-17, and
appendix C).


We found that the codebase includes unit tests with fairly
good coverage. However, we did find some issues that
would have been found with more extensive unit testing
(e.g., TOB-ZKTRIE-4). We recommend using the test
coverage tools described in appendix D to achieve full
coverage of all code branches.


Additionally, negative testing and fuzz testing could be
used to find most findings that result in a program panic.
Appendix E and appendix F present two ways of testing
the codebase. All publicly facing functionality should be
extensively tested using fuzz testing. Other than these
tests, static analysis tools like `golangci-lint` and
Semgrep should be integrated into Scroll’s CI/CD pipeline.

## Detailed Findings

1. Lack of domain separation allows proof forgery


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Cryptography Finding ID: TOB-ZKTRIE-1


Target: `trie/zk_trie_node.go`


Description
Merkle trees are nested tree data structures in which the hash of each branch node
depends upon the hashes of its children. The hash of each node is then assumed to
uniquely represent the subtree of which that node is a root. However, that assumption may
be false if a leaf node can have the same hash as a branch node. A general method for
preventing leaf and branch nodes from colliding in this way is _domain separation_ . That is,
given a hash function 𝐻, define the hash of a leaf to be 𝐻(𝑓(𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑓_𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎)) and the hash of a
branch to be 𝐻(𝑔(𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑐ℎ_𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎)), where 𝑓 and 𝑔 are encoding functions that can never
return the same result (perhaps because 𝑓’s return values all start with the byte 0 and 𝑔’s
all start with the byte 1). Without domain separation, a malicious entity may be able to
insert a leaf into the tree that can be later used as a branch in a Merkle path.


In `zktrie`, the hash for a node is defined by the `NodeHash` method, shown in figure 1.1. As
shown in the highlighted portions, the hash of a branch node is
`HashElems(n.ChildL,n.ChildR)`, while the hash of a leaf node is
`HashElems(1,n.NodeKey,n.valueHash)` .

```
 // LeafHash computes the key of a leaf node given the hIndex and hValue of the
 // entry of the leaf.
 func LeafHash(k, v *zkt.Hash) (*zkt.Hash, error) {
     return zkt.HashElems(big.NewInt(1), k.BigInt(), v.BigInt())
 }

 // NodeHash computes the hash digest of the node by hashing the content in a
 // specific way for each type of node. This key is used as the hash of the
 // Merkle tree for each node.
 func (n *Node) NodeHash() (*zkt.Hash, error) {
     if n.nodeHash == nil { // Cache the key to avoid repeated hash computations.
         // NOTE: We are not using the type to calculate the hash!
         switch n.Type {
         case NodeTypeParent: // H(ChildL || ChildR)
             var err error
             n.nodeHash, err = zkt.HashElems(n.ChildL.BigInt(), n.ChildR.BigInt())

```

```
if err != nil {

```

```
        return nil, err
    }
case NodeTypeLeaf:

```

```
            var err error
            n.valueHash, err = zkt.PreHandlingElems(n.CompressedFlags,
n.ValuePreimage)

```

```
if err != nil {

```

```
    return nil, err
}
n.nodeHash, err = LeafHash(n.NodeKey, n.valueHash)
if err != nil {

```

```
    return nil, err
}

```

```
case NodeTypeEmpty: // Zero
    n.nodeHash = &zkt.HashZero
default:

```

```
             n.nodeHash = &zkt.HashZero
         }
     }
     return n.nodeHash, nil
 }
```

_Figure 1.1:_ _`NodeHash`_ _and_ _`LeafHash`_ _(_ _`[zktrie/trie/zk_trie_node.go#118–156](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zktrie/blob/90179c19281670f41c54bd80ab01e4d64c860521/trie/zk_trie_node.go#L118-L156)`_ _)_


The function `HashElems` used here performs recursive hashing in a binary-tree fashion.
For the purpose of this finding, the key property is that `HashElems(1,k,v)` `==`
`H(H(1,k),v)` and `HashElems(n.ChildL,n.ChildR)` `==` `H(n.ChildL,n.ChildR)`,
where `H` is the global two-input, one-output hash function. Therefore, a branch node `b` and
a leaf node `l` where `b.ChildL` `==` `H(1,l.NodeKey)` and `b.ChildR` `==` `l.valueHash`
will have equal hash values.


This allows proof forgery and, for example, a malicious entity to insert a key that can be
proved to be both present and nonexistent in the tree, as illustrated by the
proof-of-concept test in figure 1.2.

```
 func TestMerkleTree_ForgeProof(t *testing.T) {
     zkTrie := newTestingMerkle(t, 10)

     t.Run("Testing for malicious proofs", func(t *testing.T) {

         // Find two distinct values k1,k2 such that the first step of
         // the path has the sibling on the LEFT (i.e., path[0] ==
         // false)
         k1, k2 := (func() (zkt.Byte32, zkt.Byte32) {
             k1 := zkt.Byte32{1}
             k2 := zkt.Byte32{2}
             k1_hash, _ := k1.Hash()

Exploit Scenario
Suppose Alice uses the `zktrie` to implement the Ethereum account table in a
zkEVM-based bridge with trustless state updates. Bob submits a transaction that inserts
specially crafted account data into some position in that tree. At a later time, Bob submits a
transaction that depends on the result of an account table lookup. Bob generates two
contradictory Merkle proofs and uses those proofs to create two zkEVM execution proofs
that step to different final states. By submitting one proof each to the opposite sides of the
bridge, Bob causes state divergence and a loss of funds.


Recommendations
Short term, modify `NodeHash` to domain-separate leaves and branches, such as by
changing the branch hash to `zkt.HashElems(big.NewInt(2),n.ChildL.BigInt(),`
`n.ChildR.BigInt())` .

2. Lack of proof validation causes denial of service on the verifier


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ZKTRIE-2


Target: `trie/zk_trie_impl.go`


Description
The Merkle tree proof verifier assumes several well-formedness properties about the
received proof and node arguments. If at least one of these properties is violated, the
verifier will have a runtime error.


The first property that must hold is that the node associated with the Merkle proof must be
a leaf node (i.e., must contain a non-nil `NodeKey` field). If this is not the case, computing the
`rootFromProof` for a `nil NodeKey` will cause a panic when computing the `getPath`
function.


Secondly, the `Proof` fields must be guaranteed to be consistent with the other fields.
Assuming that the proof depth is correct will cause out-of-bounds accesses to both the
`NodeKey` and the `notempties` field. Finally, the `Siblings` array length should also be
validated; for example, the `VerifyProofZkTrie` will panic due to an out-of-bounds access
if the `proof.Siblings` field is empty (highlighted in yellow in the `rootFromProof`
function).

3. Two incompatible ways to generate proofs


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ZKTRIE-3


Target: `trie/{zk_trie.go, zk_trie_impl.go}`


Description
There are two incompatible ways to generate proofs.


The first implementation (figure 3.1) writes to a given callback, effectively returning

`[]bytes` . It does not have a companion verification function; it has only positive tests
( `[zktrie/trie/zk_trie_test.go#L93-L125](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zktrie/blob/90179c19281670f41c54bd80ab01e4d64c860521/trie/zk_trie_test.go#L93-L125)` ); and it is accessible from the C function
`TrieProve` and the Rust function `prove` .


The second implementation (figure 3.2) returns a pointer to a `Proof` struct. It has a
companion verification function ( `[zktrie/trie/zk_trie_impl.go#L595-L632](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zktrie/blob/90179c19281670f41c54bd80ab01e4d64c860521/trie/zk_trie_impl.go#L595-L632)` ); it has
positive and negative tests ( `[zktrie/trie/zk_trie_impl_test.go#L484-L537](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zktrie/blob/90179c19281670f41c54bd80ab01e4d64c860521/trie/zk_trie_impl_test.go#L484-L537)` ); and it is
not accessible from C or Rust.

```
 // Prove is a simlified calling of ProveWithDeletion
 func (t *ZkTrie) Prove(key []byte, fromLevel uint, writeNode func(*Node) error)
 error {
     return t.ProveWithDeletion(key, fromLevel, writeNode, nil)

 //
 // If the trie does not contain a value for key, the returned proof contains all
 // nodes of the longest existing prefix of the key (at least the root node), ending
 // with the node that proves the absence of the key.
 //
 // If the trie contain value for key, the onHit is called BEFORE writeNode being
 called,
 // both the hitted leaf node and its sibling node is provided as arguments so caller
 // would receive enough information for launch a deletion and calculate the new root
 // base on the proof data

4. BuildZkTrieProof does not populate NodeAux.Value


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Testing Finding ID: TOB-ZKTRIE-4


Target: `trie/zk_trie_impl.go`


Description
A nonexistence proof for some key `k` in a Merkle tree is a Merkle path from the root of the
tree to a subtree, which would contain `k` if it were present but which instead is either an
empty subtree or a subtree with a single leaf `k2` where `k` `!=` `k2` . In the `zktrie` codebase,
that second case is handled by the `NodeAux` field in the `Proof` struct, as illustrated in figure
4.1.

```
 // Verify the proof and calculate the root, nodeHash can be nil when try to verify
 // a nonexistent proof
 func (proof *Proof) Verify(nodeHash, nodeKey *zkt.Hash) (*zkt.Hash, error) {

When a non-inclusion proof is generated, the `BuildZkTrieProof` function looks up the
other leaf node and uses its `NodeKey` and `valueHash` fields to populate the `Key` and
`Value` fields of `NodeAux`, as shown in figure 4.2. However, the `valueHash` field of this node

may be `nil`, causing `NodeAux.Value` to be `nil` and causing proof verification to crash

5. Leaf nodes with different values may have the same hash


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Cryptography Finding ID: TOB-ZKTRIE-5


Target: `trie/zk_trie_node.go`, `types/util.go`


Description
The hash value of a leaf node is derived from the hash of its key and its value. A leaf node’s
value comprises up to 256 32-byte fields, and that value’s hash is computed by passing
those fields to the `HashElems` function. `HashElems` hashes these fields in a Merkle
tree–style binary tree pattern, as shown in figure 5.1.

```
 func HashElems(fst, snd *big.Int, elems ...*big.Int) (*Hash, error) {
     l := len(elems)
     baseH, err := hashScheme([]*big.Int{fst, snd})
     if err != nil {

```

```
    return nil, err
}
if l == 0 {

```

```
    return NewHashFromBigInt(baseH), nil
} else if l == 1 {

```

```
    return HashElems(baseH, elems[0])
}
tmp := make([]*big.Int, (l+1)/2)
for i := range tmp {

```

```
if (i+1)*2 > l {

```

```
             tmp[i] = elems[i*2]
         } else {
             h, err := hashScheme(elems[i*2 : (i+1)*2])
             if err != nil {
                 return nil, err
             }
             tmp[i] = h
         }
     }

     return HashElems(baseH, tmp[0], tmp[1:]...)
 }
```

However, `HashElems` does not include the number of elements being hashed, so leaf
nodes with different values may have the same hash, as illustrated in the proof-of-concept

7. CanonicalValue is not canonical


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Cryptography Finding ID: TOB-ZKTRIE-7


Target: `trie/zk_trie_node.go`


Description
The `CanonicalValue` function does not uniquely generate a representation of `Node`
structures, allowing different `Nodes` with the same `CanonicalValue`, and two nodes with
the same `NodeHash` but different `CanonicalValues` .


`ValuePreimages` in a `Node` can be either uncompressed or compressed (by hashing); the
`CompressedFlags` value indicates which data is compressed.


Only the first 24 fields can be compressed, so `CanonicalValue` truncates
`CompressedFlags` to the first 24 bits. But `NewLeafNode` accepts any `uint32` for the
`CompressedFlags` field of a `Node` . Figure 7.3 shows how this can be used to construct two
different `Node` structs that have the same `CanonicalValue` .

```
 // CanonicalValue returns the byte form of a node required to be persisted, and
 strip unnecessary fields
 // from the encoding (current only KeyPreimage for Leaf node) to keep a minimum size
 for content being
 // stored in backend storage
 func (n *Node) CanonicalValue() []byte {
     switch n.Type {
     case NodeTypeParent: // {Type || ChildL || ChildR}
         bytes := []byte{byte(n.Type)}

8. ToSecureKey and ToSecureKeyBytes implicitly truncate the key


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ZKTRIE-8


Target: `types/util.go`


Description
`ToSecureKey` and `ToSecureKeyBytes` accept a key of arbitrary length but implicitly
truncate it to 32 bytes.


`ToSecureKey` makes an underlying call to `NewByte32FromBytesPaddingZero` that
truncates the key to its first 32 bytes. The `ToSecureKeyBytes` function also truncates the
key because it calls `ToSecureKey` .

```
 // ToSecureKey turn the byte key into the integer represent of "secured" key

     word := NewByte32FromBytesPaddingZero(key)
     return word.Hash()
 }

Short term, fix the `ToSecureKey` and `ToSecureKeyBytes` functions so that they do not
truncate keys that are longer than 32 bytes, and instead hash all the bytes. If this behavior
is not desired, ensure that the functions return an error if given a key longer than 32 bytes.

10. The PreHandlingElems function panics with an empty elems array


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **Low**

Description
The `PreHandlingElems` function experiences a runtime error when the `elems` array is
empty. There is an early return path for when the array has fewer than two elements that
assumes there is at least one element. If this is not the case, there will be an out-of-bounds
access that will cause a runtime error.

```
 func PreHandlingElems(flagArray uint32, elems []Byte32) (*Hash, error) {
     ret := make([]*big.Int, len(elems))
     var err error

     for i, elem := range elems {
         if flagArray&(1<<i) != 0 {
             ret[i], err = elem.Hash()
             if err != nil {
                 return nil, err
             }
         } else {
             ret[i] = new(big.Int).SetBytes(elem[:])
         }
     }

     if len(ret) < 2 {

Figure 10.2 shows tests that demonstrate this issue by directly calling `PreHandlingElems`
with an empty array and by triggering the issue via the `NodeHash` function.

```

_Figure 10.2: Tests that trigger the out-of-bounds access_


Note that the `TrieUpdate` exported function would also trigger the same issue if called
with an empty `vPreimage` argument, but this is checked in the function.


It is also possible to trigger this panic from the Rust API by calling `ZkTrieNode::parse`
with the byte array obtained from the `Value()` function operated on a maliciously
constructed leaf node. This is because `ZkTrieNode::parse` will eventually call
`NewNodeFromBytes` and the `NodeHash` function on that node. The `NewNodeFromBytes`
function also does not validate that the newly created node is well formed (TOB-ZKTRIE-14).

```
 #[test]
 fn test_zktrienode_parse() {
   let buff =
 hex::decode("011baa09b39b1016e6be4467f3d58c1e1859d5e883514ff707551a9355a5941e2200000

   let _node = ZkTrieNode::parse(&buff);
 }
```

_Figure 10.3: A test that triggers the out-of-bounds access from the Rust API_


Both the `Data()` and `String()` functions also panic when operated on a `Node` receiver

// Data returns the wrapped data inside LeafNode and cast them into bytes
// for other node type it just return nil
func (n *Node) Data() []byte {

12. Mishandling of cgo.Handles causes runtime errors


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ZKTRIE-12


Target: `lib.go`


Description
The interaction between the Rust and Go codebases relies on the use of `[cgo.Handles](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/cgo#Handle)` .
These handles are a way to encode Go pointers between Go and, in this case, Rust. Handles
can be passed back to the Go runtime, which will be able to retrieve the original Go value.


According to the documentation, it is safe to represent an error with the zero value, as this
is an invalid handle. However, the implementation should take this into account when
retrieving the Go values from the handle, as both the `Value` and `Delete` methods for
`Handles` panic on invalid handles.


The codebase contains multiple instances of this behavior. For example, the `NewTrieNode`
function will return `0` if it finds an error:


```
// parse raw bytes and create the trie node
//export NewTrieNode
func NewTrieNode(data *C.char, sz C.int) C.uintptr_t {

```

```
bt := C.GoBytes(unsafe.Pointer(data), sz)
n, err := trie.NewNodeFromBytes(bt)
if err != nil {

```

```
    return 0
}

```

```
// calculate key for caching
if _, err := n.NodeHash(); err != nil {
    return 0
}

```

```
     return C.uintptr_t(cgo.NewHandle(n))
 }
```

_Figure 12.1:_ _`[zktrie/lib.go#73–88](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zktrie/blob/90179c19281670f41c54bd80ab01e4d64c860521/lib.go#L73-L88)`_


However, neither the Rust API nor the Go API takes these cases into consideration. Looking
at the Rust API, the `ZkTrieNode::parse` function will simply save the result from
`NewTrieNode` regardless of whether it is a valid or invalid Go handle. Then, calling any
other function will cause a runtime error due to the use of an invalid handle. This issue is


Trail of Bits 46 Scroll zkTrie Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


present in all functions implemented for `ZkTrieNode` : `drop`, `node_hash`, and
`value_hash` .


We now precisely describe how it fails in the `drop` function case. After constructing a
malformed `ZkTrieNode`, the `drop` function will call `FreeTrieNode` on the invalid handle:

```
 impl Drop for ZkTrieNode {
   fn drop(&mut self) {
     unsafe { FreeTrieNode(self.trie_node) };
   }
 }
```

This will cause a panic given the direct use of the invalid handle on the `Handle.Delete`
function:

```
 // free created trie node
 //export FreeTrieNode
 func FreeTrieNode(p C.uintptr_t) { freeObject(p) }

 func freeObject(p C.uintptr_t) {
     h := cgo.Handle(p)
     h.Delete()
 }
```

Recommendations
Short term, ensure that invalid handles are not used with `Delete` or `Value` ; for this,
document the Go exported function requirements, and ensure that Rust checks for this
before these functions are called.

13. Unnecessary unsafe pointer manipulation in Node.Data()


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-ZKTRIE-13


Target: `trie/zk_trie_node.go`


Description
The `Node.Data()` function returns the underlying value of a leaf node as a byte slice (i.e.,

`[]byte` ). Since the `ValuePreimage` field is a slice of `zkt.Byte32` s, returning a value of
type `[]byte` requires some form of conversion. The implementation, shown in figure 13.1,
uses the `reflect` and `unsafe` packages to manually construct a byte slice that overlaps
with `ValuePreimage` .


```
case NodeTypeLeaf:

```

```
    var data []byte
    hdata := (*reflect.SliceHeader)(unsafe.Pointer(&data))
    //TODO: uintptr(reflect.ValueOf(n.ValuePreimage).UnsafePointer()) should be
more elegant but only available until go 1.18

```

```
hdata.Data = uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&n.ValuePreimage[0]))
hdata.Len = 32 * len(n.ValuePreimage)
hdata.Cap = hdata.Len
return data

```

Manual construction of slices and unsafe casting between pointer types are error-prone
and potentially very dangerous. This particular case appears to be harmless, but it is
unnecessary and can be replaced by allocating a byte buffer and copying `ValuePreimage`
into it.


Recommendations
Short term, replace this unsafe cast with code that allocated a byte buffer and then copies
`ValuePreimage`, as described above.


Long term, evaluate all uses of unsafe pointer manipulation and replace them with a safe
alternative where possible.

14. NewNodeFromBytes does not fully validate its input


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ZKTRIE-14


Target: `trie/zk_trie_node.go`


Description
The `NewNodeFromBytes` function parses a byte array into a value of type `Node` . It checks
several requirements for the `Node` value and returns `nil` and an error value if those checks
fail. However, it allows a zero-length value for `ValuePreimage` (which allows
TOB-ZKTRIE-10 to be exploited) and ignores extra data at the end of leaf and empty nodes.
As shown in figure 14.1, the exact length of the byte array is checked in the case of a
branch, but is unchecked for empty nodes and only lower-bounded in the case of a leaf
node.

```
 case NodeTypeParent:
     if len(b) != 2*zkt.HashByteLen {
         return nil, ErrNodeBytesBadSize
     }
     n.ChildL = zkt.NewHashFromBytes(b[:zkt.HashByteLen])
     n.ChildR = zkt.NewHashFromBytes(b[zkt.HashByteLen : zkt.HashByteLen*2])
 case NodeTypeLeaf:
     if len(b) < zkt.HashByteLen+4 {
         return nil, ErrNodeBytesBadSize
     }
     n.NodeKey = zkt.NewHashFromBytes(b[0:zkt.HashByteLen])
     mark := binary.LittleEndian.Uint32(b[zkt.HashByteLen : zkt.HashByteLen+4])
     preimageLen := int(mark & 255)
     n.CompressedFlags = mark >> 8
     n.ValuePreimage = make([]zkt.Byte32, preimageLen)
     curPos := zkt.HashByteLen + 4

15. init_hash_scheme is not thread-safe


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-ZKTRIE-15


Target: `src/lib.rs`, `lib.go`, `c.go`, `types/hash.go`


Description
`zktrie` provides a safe-Rust interface around its Go implementation. Safe Rust statically
prevents various memory safety errors, including null pointer dereferences and data races.
However, when unsafe Rust is wrapped in a safe interface, the unsafe code must provide
any guarantees that safe Rust expects. For more information about writing unsafe Rust,
[consult The Rustonomicon.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/intro.html)


The `init_hash_scheme` function, shown in figure 15.1, calls `InitHashScheme`, which is a
`cgo` wrapper for the Go function shown in figure 15.2.

```
 pub fn init_hash_scheme(f: HashScheme) {
   unsafe { InitHashScheme(f) }
 }
```

_Figure 15.1:_ _`[src/lib.rs#67–69](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zktrie/blob/90179c19281670f41c54bd80ab01e4d64c860521/src/lib.rs#L67-L69)`_

```
 // notice the function must use C calling convention
 //export InitHashScheme
 func InitHashScheme(f unsafe.Pointer) {
     hash_f := C.hashF(f)
     C.init_hash_scheme(hash_f)
     zkt.InitHashScheme(hash_external)
 }
```

_Figure 15.2:_ _`[lib.go#65–71](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zktrie/blob/90179c19281670f41c54bd80ab01e4d64c860521/lib.go#L65-L71)`_


`InitHashScheme` calls two other functions: first, a C function called `init_hash_scheme`
and second, a second Go function (this time, in the `hash` module) called `InitHashScheme` .


This second Go function is synchronized with a `sync.Once` object, as shown in figure 15.3.

```
 func InitHashScheme(f func([]*big.Int) (*big.Int, error)) {
     setHashScheme.Do(func() {
         hashScheme = f
     })
 }
```

Trail of Bits 52 Scroll zkTrie Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


However, the C function `init_hash_scheme`, shown in figure 15.4, performs a completely
unsynchronized write to the global variable `hash_scheme`, which can lead to a data race.

```
 void init_hash_scheme(hashF f){
     hash_scheme = f;
 }
```

However, the only potential data race comes from multi-threaded initialization, which
contradicts the usage recommendation in the `README`, shown in figure 15.5.

```
 We must init the crate with a poseidon hash scheme before any actions:

 …

 zktrie_util::init_hash_scheme(hash_scheme);
```

Recommendations
Short term, add synchronization to `C.init_hash_scheme`, perhaps by using the same
`sync.Once` object as `hash.go` .


Long term, carefully review all interactions between C and Rust, paying special attention to
[anything mentioned in the “How Safe and Unsafe Interact” section of the Rustonomicon.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/safe-unsafe-meaning.html)

Severity: **High** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-ZKTRIE-16


Target: `lib.go,src/lib.rs,trie/zk_trie_database.go`


Description
The Go function `Database.Init`, shown in figure 16.1, is not thread-safe. In particular, if it
is called from multiple threads, a data race may occur when writing to the map. In normal
usage, that is not a problem; any user of the `Database.Init` function is expected to run
the function only during initialization, when synchronization is not required.

```
 // Init flush db with batches of k/v without locking
 func (db *Database) Init(k, v []byte) {
     db.db[string(k)] = v
 }
```

However, this function is called by the safe Rust function `ZkMemoryDb::add_node_bytes`
(figure 16.2) via the `cgo` function `InitDbByNode` (figure 16.3):

```
 pub fn add_node_bytes(&mut self, data: &[u8]) -> Result<(), ErrString> {

Safe Rust is required to never invoke undefined behavior, such as data races. When
wrapping unsafe Rust code, including FFI calls, care must be taken to ensure that safe Rust
[code cannot invoke undefined behavior through that wrapper. (Refer to the “How Safe and](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/safe-unsafe-meaning.html)
[Unsafe Interact” section of the Rustonomicon.) Although](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/safe-unsafe-meaning.html) `add_node_bytes` takes `&mut`
`self`, and thus cannot be called from more than one thread at once, a second reference to
the database can be created in a way that Rust’s borrow checker cannot track, by calling
`new_trie` . Figures 16.4, 16.5, and 16.6 show the call trace by which a pointer to the
`Database` is stored in the `ZkTrieImpl` .

```
 pub fn new_trie(&mut self, root: &Hash) -> Option<ZkTrie> {
   let ret = unsafe { NewZkTrie( root.as_ptr(), self.db) };

Then, by calling `add_node_bytes` in one thread and `ZkTrie::root()` or some other
method that calls `Database.Get()`, one can trigger a data race from safe Rust.


Exploit Scenario
A Rust-based library consumer uses threads to improve performance. Relying on Rust’s
type system, they assume that thread safety has been enforced and they run
`ZkMemoryDb::add_node_bytes` in a multi-threaded scenario. A data race occurs and the
system crashes.


Recommendations
Short term, add synchronization to `Database.Init`, such as by calling `db.lock.Lock()` .


Long term, carefully review all interactions between C and Rust, paying special attention to
[guidance in the “How Safe and Unsafe Interact” section of the Rustonomicon.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/safe-unsafe-meaning.html)

Target: `lib.go`, `trie/zk_trie_node.go`


Description
The `Node.NodeHash` and `Node.ValueHash` methods each return the zero hash in cases in
which an error return would be more appropriate. In the case of `NodeHash`, all invalid node
types return the zero hash, the same hash as an empty node (shown in figure 17.1).


```
case NodeTypeEmpty: // Zero

```

```
    n.nodeHash = &zkt.HashZero
default:

```

```
        n.nodeHash = &zkt.HashZero

In the case of `ValueHash`, non-leaf nodes have a zero value hash, as shown in figure 17.2.

```
 func (n *Node) ValueHash() (*zkt.Hash, error) {
     if n.Type != NodeTypeLeaf {
         return &zkt.HashZero, nil
     }
```

In both of these cases, returning an error is more appropriate and prevents potential
confusion if client software assumes that the main return value is valid whenever the error
returned is `nil` .


Recommendations
Short term, have the functions return an error in these cases instead of the zero hash.


Long term, ensure that exceptional cases lead to non- `nil` error returns rather than default
values.

18. get_account can read past the buffer


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Data Exposure Finding ID: TOB-ZKTRIE-18


Target: `lib.rs`


Description
The public `get_account` function assumes that the provided key corresponds to an
account key. However, if the function is instead called with a storage key, it will cause an
out-of-bounds read that could leak secret information.


In the Rust implementation, leaf nodes can have two types of values: accounts and storage.
Account values have a size of either 128 or 160 bytes depending on whether they include
one or two code hashes. On the other hand, storage values always have a size of 32 bytes.


The `get_account` function takes a key and returns the account associated with it. In
practice, it computes the value pointer associated with the key and reads 128 or 160 bytes
at that address.


If the key contains a storage value rather than an account value, then `get_account` reads
96 or 128 bytes past the buffer. This is shown in figure 18.4.

```
 // get account data from account trie
 pub fn get_account(&self, key: &[u8]) -> Option<AccountData> {
   self.get::<ACCOUNTSIZE>(key). map(|arr| unsafe {

19. Unchecked usize to c_int casts allow hash collisions by length
misinterpretation


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-ZKTRIE-19


Target: `lib.rs`


Description
A set of unchecked integer casting operations can lead to hash collisions and runtime
errors reached from the public Rust interface.


The Rust library regularly needs to convert the input function’s byte array length from the
`usize` type to the `c_int` type. Depending on the architecture, these types might differ in
size and signedness. This difference allows an attacker to provide an array with a
maliciously chosen length that will be cast to a different number. The attacker can choose
to manipulate the array and cast the value to a smaller value than the actual array length,
allowing the attacker to create two leaf nodes from different byte arrays that result in the
same hash. The attacker is also able to cast the value to a negative number, causing a
runtime error when the Go library calls the `GoBytes` function.


The issue is caused by the explicit and unchecked cast using the `as` operator and occurs in
the `ZkTrieNode::parse`, `ZkMemoryDb::add_node_bytes`, `ZkTrie::get`,
`ZkTrie::prove`, `ZkTrie::update`, and `ZkTrie::delete` functions (all of which are
public). Figure 19.1 shows `ZkTrieNode::parse` :

```
 impl ZkTrieNode {
   pub fn parse(data: &[u8]) -> Self {
     Self {
        trie_node: unsafe { NewTrieNode(data.as_ptr(), data.len() as c_int) },
     }
   }
```

_Figure 19.1:_ _`[zktrie/src/lib.rs#133–138](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zktrie/blob/90179c19281670f41c54bd80ab01e4d64c860521/src/lib.rs#L133-L138)`_


To achieve a collision for nodes constructed from different byte arrays, first observe that
`(c_int::MAX` `as` `usize)` `*` `2` `+` `2` is `0` when cast to `c_int` . Thus, creating two nodes
that have the same prefix and are then padded with different bytes with that length will
cause the Go library to interpret only the common prefix of these nodes. The following test
showcases this exploit.

```
 #[test]
 fn invalid_cast() {
   init_hash_scheme(hash_scheme);
   // common prefix
   let nd =
 &hex::decode("012098f5fb9e239eab3ceac3f27b81e481dc3124d55ffed523a839ee8446b648640101

   // create node1 with prefix padded by zeroes
   let mut vec_nd = nd.to_vec();
   let mut zero_padd_data = vec![0u8; (c_int::MAX as usize) * 2 + 2];
   vec_nd.append(&mut zero_padd_data);
   let node1 = ZkTrieNode::parse(&vec_nd);

   // create node2 with prefix padded by ones
   let mut vec_nd = nd.to_vec();
   let mut one_padd_data = vec![1u8; (c_int::MAX as usize) * 2 + 2];
   vec_nd.append(&mut one_padd_data);
   let node2 = ZkTrieNode::parse(&vec_nd);

   // create node3 with just the prefix
   let node3 =
 ZkTrieNode::parse(&hex::decode("012098f5fb9e239eab3ceac3f27b81e481dc3124d55ffed523a8
 39ee8446b64864010100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000018282256f
 8b00").unwrap());

   // all hashes are equal
   assert_eq!(node1.node_hash(), node2.node_hash());
   assert_eq!(node1.node_hash(), node3.node_hash());
 }
```

_Figure 19.2: A test showing three different leaf nodes with colliding hashes_


This finding also allows an attacker to cause a runtime error by choosing the data array
with the appropriate length that will cause the cast to result in a negative number. Figure
19.2 shows a test that triggers the runtime error for the `parse` function:

```
 #[test]
 fn invalid_cast() {
   init_hash_scheme(hash_scheme);

   let data = vec![0u8; c_int::MAX as usize + 1];
   println!("{:?}", data.len() as c_int);

   let _nd = ZkTrieNode::parse(&data);
 }

 // running 1 test
 // -2147483648
 // panic: runtime error: gobytes: length out of range

 // goroutine 17 [running, locked to thread]:

```

_Figure 19.3: A test that triggers the issue, whose output shows the reinterpreted length of the_

_array_


Exploit Scenario
An attacker provides two different byte arrays that will have the same `node_hash`,
breaking the assumption that such nodes are hard to obtain.


Recommendations
Short term, have the code perform the cast in a checked manner by using the
`[c_int::try_from](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/convert/trait.TryFrom.html#examples)` method to allow validation if the conversion succeeds. Determine
whether the Rust functions should allow arbitrary length inputs; document the length
requirements and assumptions.


Long term, regularly run Clippy in pedantic mode to find and fix all potentially dangerous
casts.

**●** **Redundant error handling.** The following code should simply check whether
`err!=` `nil` and then return `nil,` `err` .

## D. Automated Analysis Tool Confgurationi

As part of this assessment, we used the tools described below to perform automated
testing of the codebase.


D.1. golangci-lint

[We used the static analyzer aggregator golangci-lint to quickly analyze the codebase.](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/quick-start/)


D.2. Semgrep

[We used the static analyzer Semgrep to search for weaknesses in the source code](https://semgrep.dev/)
repository. Note that these rule sets will output repeated results, which should be ignored.

```
 git clone git@github.com:dgryski/semgrep-go.git

 semgrep --metrics=off --sarif --config semgrep-go
 semgrep --metrics=off --sarif --config semgrep-rules
```

_Figure D.1: The commands used to run Semgrep_


D.3. CodeQL

We analyzed the Go codebase with Trail of Bits’s private CodeQL queries. We recommend
that Scroll review CodeQL’s licensing policies if it intends to run CodeQL.

```
 # Create the go database
 codeql database create codeql.db --language=go

 # Run all go queries
 codeql database analyze codeql.db --additional-packs ~/.codeql/codeql-repo
 --format=sarif-latest --output=codeql_tob_all.sarif -- tob-go-all
```

_Figure D.2: Commands used to run CodeQL_


D.4. go cover

We ran the go cover tool with the following command on both the `trie` and `types` folders
to obtain a test coverage report:

```
go test -cover -coverprofile c.out && go tool cover -html=c.out

```

Note that this needs to be run separately for each folder.

D.5. cargo audit

[This tool audits](https://github.com/RustSec/rustsec/tree/main/cargo-audit) `Cargo.lock` against the RustSec advisory database. This tool did not reveal
any findings but should be run every time new dependencies are included in the codebase.


D.6. cargo-llvm-cov

[cargo-llvm-cov generates Rust code coverage reports. We used the](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov) `cargo` `llvm-cov`
`--open` command to generate a coverage report for the Rust tests.


D.7. Clippy

[The Rust linter Clippy can be installed using](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) `rustup` by running the command `rustup`
`component add clippy` . Invoking `cargo clippy --workspace -- -W clippy::pedantic`
in the root directory of the project runs the tool. Clippy warns about casting operations
from `usize` to `c_int` that resulted in finding TOB-ZKTRIE-19.

## E. Go Fuzzing Harness

During the assessment, we wrote a fuzzing harness for the Merkle tree proof verifier
function. Because native Go does not support all necessary types, some proof structure
types had to be manually constructed. Some parts of the proof were built naively, and the
fuzzing harness can be iteratively improved by Scroll’s team. Running the `go` `test`
`-fuzz=FuzzVerifyProofZkTrie` command will start the fuzzing campaign.

// Truncate or pad array to length sz
func padtolen(arr []byte, sz int) []byte {

```
if len(arr) < sz {

```
    arr = append(arr, bytes.Repeat([]byte{0}, sz-len(arr))...)
} else {

```
        arr = arr[:sz]
    }
    return arr
}

## F. Go Randomized Test

During the assessment, we wrote a simple randomized test to verify that the behavior of
the zkTrie matches an ideal tree (i.e., an associative array). The test currently fails due to
the verifier misbehavior described in this report.


The test can be run with `go` `test` `-v` `-run` `TestZkTrie_BasicRandomTest` .

     const NUM_KEYS = 1024

     keys := random_hex_str_array(t, NUM_BYTES, NUM_KEYS)
     data := random_hex_str_array(t, NUM_BYTES, NUM_KEYS)

     // PHASE 1: toss a coin and set elements (Works)
     for i := 0; i < len(keys); i++ {
         if toss(t) == true {
             set(t, zkTrie, idealTrie, keys[i], data[i])
         }
     }
     // PHASE 2: toss a coin and get elements (Fails)
     for i := 0; i < len(keys); i++ {
         if toss(t) == true {
             get(t, zkTrie, idealTrie, keys[i])
         }
     }
     // PHASE 3: toss a coin and remove elements (Fails)
     for i := 0; i < len(keys); i++ {
         if toss(t) == true {

## G. Fix Review Results

When undertaking a fix review, Trail of Bits reviews the fixes implemented for issues
identified in the original report. This work involves a review of specific areas of the source
code and system configuration, not comprehensive analysis of the system.


On September 13, 2023, Trail of Bits reviewed the fixes and mitigations implemented by the
Scroll team for the issues identified in this report. We reviewed each fix to determine its
effectiveness in resolving the associated issue.


Trail of Bits received fix PRs for findings TOB-ZKTRIE-1, TOB-ZKTRIE-4, TOB-ZKTRIE-5,
TOB-ZKTRIE-16, TOB-ZKTRIE-18, and TOB-ZKTRIE-19. Scroll did not provide fix PRs for the
medium-severity findings TOB-ZKTRIE-2, TOB-ZKTRIE-10, and TOB-ZKTRIE-12; the
low-severity finding TOB-ZKTRIE-11; or the remaining findings, all of which are of
informational severity.


In summary, of the 19 issues described in this report, Scroll has resolved five issues and
has partially resolved one issue. No fix PRs were provided for the remaining 13 issues, so
their fix statuses are undetermined. For additional information, please see the Detailed Fix

#### Detailed Fix Review Results

**TOB-ZKTRIE-1: Lack of domain separation allows proof forgery**
[Resolved in PR #11.](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zktrie/pull/11) Domain separation is now performed between leaves, `Byte32` values,
and several different types of internal branches. Additionally, sequence-length domain
separation has been added to `HashElems` as part of the fixes for finding TOB-ZKTRIE-5.
`HashElemsWithDomain` does not add its own domain separation and is potentially
error-prone. It appears to be used correctly, but the Scroll team should consider making
`HashElemsWithDomain` private to prevent misuse.


**TOB-ZKTRIE-2: Lack of proof validation causes denial of service on the verifier**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-ZKTRIE-3: Two incompatible ways to generate proofs**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-ZKTRIE-4: BuildZkTrieProof does not populate NodeAux.Value**
[Resolved in PR #11. The](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zktrie/pull/11) `BuildZkTrieProof` function now calls `ValueHash`, which
populates `NodeAux` .


**TOB-ZKTRIE-5: Leaf nodes with different values may have the same hash**
[Resolved in PR #11.](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zktrie/pull/11) `NodeHash` now uses `HandlingElemsAndByte32`, which calls
`HashElems`, which adds domain separation based on the length of its input to recursive
calls in the internal Merkle tree structure.


**TOB-ZKTRIE-6: Empty UpdatePreimage function body**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-ZKTRIE-7: CanonicalValue is not canonical**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-ZKTRIE-8: ToSecureKey and ToSecureKeyBytes implicitly truncate the key**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-ZKTRIE-9: Unused key argument on the bridge_prove_write function**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.

**TOB-ZKTRIE-14: NewNodeFromBytes does not fully validate its input**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-ZKTRIE-15: init_hash_scheme is not thread-safe**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-ZKTRIE-16: Safe-Rust ZkMemoryDb interface is not thread-safe**
[Resolved in PR #12. The use of the non-thread-safe function](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zktrie/pull/12) `Database.Init` was replaced
with `Put`, which is thread-safe. The Scroll team should consider adding cautionary
documentation to `Init` to prevent its misuse in the future.


**TOB-ZKTRIE-17: Some Node functions return the zero hash instead of errors**
Undetermined. No fix was provided for this issue, so we do not know whether this issue
has been addressed.


**TOB-ZKTRIE-18: get_account can read past the buffer**
[Partially resolved in PR #13. The](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zktrie/pull/13) `get_account` function now verifies the slice length.
However, the function may still misbehave on platforms where Go’s `int` type is 32 bits and

31
if given a value above 2, which may cause the cast to overflow. This seems extremely

unlikely to cause problems in practice. However, adding `assert` calls to `ZkTrie::get` and

30
`TrieGetSize` to restrict the size to be below a reasonable upper bound such as 2 would

prevent this issue entirely by causing the program to terminate if the affected code is
misused on a problematic platform.
