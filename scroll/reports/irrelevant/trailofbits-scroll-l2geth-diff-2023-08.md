#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

Trail of Bits 4 Scroll l2geth Diff Review Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


## Executive Summary

Scroll engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of its `l2geth` implementation at commit
hash `[be1600f](https://github.com/scroll-tech/go-ethereum/tree/be1600f07899e7b6e1b33941a2e6117a73d0b7a0)` . `l2geth` is a fork of `go-ethereum` that was developed to support Scroll’s
zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup. This review was a follow-up review to a previous `l2geth`
security assessment. The core focus of this audit was the introduction of the circuit capacity
checker (CCC), which is responsible for identifying whether a specific transaction or block is
“unprovable.”


A team of three consultants conducted the review from August 21 to August 25, 2023, for a
total of two engineer-weeks of effort. With full access to the source code, we performed a
manual review of the diff from the previous audit.


Within our main area of focus, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list of
questions:


  - Does the CCC correctly handle unprovable L1 transactions, L2 transactions, and
blocks?


  - Does the introduction of the CCC adversely affect the miner or block validation code
paths?


  - Does the system correctly log and handle errors?


  - Does the introduction of the custom tracer cause unexpected state changes or
undefined behavior?


This audit was a best-effort review of the above goals. Due to time limitations, we were
unable to identify and validate the impact of all edge cases that the CCC may introduce into
the system. Additionally, we were provided with only the API for the CCC, and the true
implementation of the CCC was treated as a black box. Thus, any issues that may arise
from an incorrect implementation of the feature were considered out of scope. Finally, the
`l2geth` diff introduced a variety of other changes, outside of the CCC, that were also
considered out of scope for this audit.


We identified a few patterns that caused the issues discovered during this audit. First, we
identified a high-severity denial-of-service (DoS) attack that would prevent the system from
fully taking advantage of the block size. This was due to a bug within the CCC
implementation. Transaction ordering risks, as well as DoS attack vectors, must be
continually considered as the codebase evolves and matures.


Second, we identified a large amount of dead or unused code. These are artifacts from the
original `go-ethereum` implementation. This technical debt makes the codebase harder to
review and increases the effort required to maintain the codebase.

Finally, there was a lack of documentation around the introduction of the CCC. Since the
CCC significantly changes the functionality of critical code paths within the system,
identifying the invariants that must be upheld is critical.


Going forward, we recommend that the Scroll team invest further efforts into improving
documentation and maturing the test suite. The documentation should hold the system’s
expected behavior to identify deviations and changes that were made from the initial
`go-ethereum` fork and should also hold any critical function- and system-level invariants
that arise from those changes. Additionally, we recommend that the team invest more time
into integration testing with a true implementation of the CCC, instead of a mock one, to
ensure that the system works as expected.

## Codebase Maturity Evaluation

Trail of Bits uses a traffic-light protocol to provide each client with a clear understanding of
the areas in which its codebase is mature, immature, or underdeveloped. Deficiencies
identified here often stem from root causes within the software development life cycle that
should be addressed through standardization measures (e.g., the use of common libraries,
functions, or frameworks) or training and awareness programs.


**Category** **Summary** **Result**



Arithmetic The diff from the previous audit did not introduce any
significant changes to the arithmetic operations
performed in the codebase.


Auditing The logging pattern provided in the diff remains
consistent with that of the original `go-ethereum` .
Sufficient trace, debug, error, and critical log events are
used to effectively triage and identify any issues within
the system.



Authentication /
Access Controls


Complexity
Management



No meaningful changes to `go-ethereum` ’s access
controls were made in `l2geth` .


As mentioned in the previous audit of `l2geth`, the
system carries a large amount of technical debt from
`go-ethereum` . This makes it harder to review the
`l2geth` code and determine whether a specific code
quirk reflects a quality issue with `l2geth` or a
workaround for a legacy feature that `go-ethereum`
maintains.


`l2geth` ’s changes also contain many unresolved “TODO”
statements and code quality issues, likely stemming from
a fast development life cycle. Full inclusion of the
`go-ethereum` source code makes code atrophy from
these changes much harder to detect against the
background of historical `go-ethereum` quirks.

Cryptography
and Key
Management



No meaningful changes to `go-ethereum` ’s cryptography
or key management were made in the diff of `l2geth` .



Decentralization As mentioned in the previous audit of `l2geth`, the
system runs using a centralized sequencer, which
represents a single point of failure and exposes off-chain
applications to potential double-spend attacks. The diff
that was audited did not make any changes to any code
paths that would affect decentralization.


Documentation There is a lack of documentation regarding the new CCC
integration. Given the criticality of the CCC for block
production and validation, as well as the nuanced
behavior of the feature, we recommend increasing
documentation in these areas to ensure that expected
behavior and properties are clear.



Memory Safety
and Error
Handling


Low-Level
Manipulation


Testing and
Verification



We identified many instances where an error is caught
and logged but not returned to the caller of the function.
Based on discussions with Scroll, these instances operate
as expected. However, this coding practice may lead to
the introduction of latent bugs and cause unhandled
errors as development continues. We recommend that
Scroll create internal guidelines to identify when and
where errors should be returned versus when they
should be only logged.


`l2geth` ’s modifications do not introduce any low-level
manipulation.


The changes made to the miner code paths were
sufficiently tested with unit tests. However, changes to
the block validation and tracing code paths were not
directly tested with unit tests. We recommend that Scroll
extend its integration testing suite so that the `l2geth`
system can be tested in tandem with a true
implementation of the CCC, instead of a mock one.

Transaction
Ordering



The prioritization of L1 transactions to be the first in a
block allowed the DoS attack that we identified. This
prioritization may also lead to additional DoS vectors or
transaction ordering–related risks. Due to time
constraints, we were unable to examine these other
potential attack vectors.

## Detailed Findings

1. Attacker can prevent L2 transactions from being added to a block


Severity: **High** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Denial of Service Finding ID: TOB-L2GETH-1


Target: `miner/worker.go`


Description
The `commitTransactions` function returns a flag that determines whether to halt
transaction production, even if the block has room for more transactions to be added.


If the circuit checker returns an error either for row consumption being too high or reasons
unknown, the `circuitCapacityReached` flag is set to `true` (figure 1.1).


```
case (errors.Is(err, circuitcapacitychecker.ErrTxRowConsumptionOverflow) &&
tx.IsL1MessageTx()):

```

```
    // Circuit capacity check: L1MessageTx row consumption too high, shift to the
next from the account,

```

```
    // because we shouldn't skip the entire txs from the same account.
    // This is also useful for skipping "problematic" L1MessageTxs.
    queueIndex := tx.AsL1MessageTx().QueueIndex
    log.Trace("Circuit capacity limit reached for a single tx", "tx",
tx.Hash().String(), "queueIndex", queueIndex)

```

```
    log.Info("Skipping L1 message", "queueIndex", queueIndex, "tx",
tx.Hash().String(), "block", w.current.header.Number, "reason", "row consumption
overflow")
    w.current.nextL1MsgIndex = queueIndex + 1

    // after `ErrTxRowConsumptionOverflow`, ccc might not revert updates
    // associated with this transaction so we cannot pack more transactions.
    // TODO: fix this in ccc and change these lines back to `txs.Shift()`
    circuitCapacityReached = true
    break loop

```

```
case (errors.Is(err, circuitcapacitychecker.ErrTxRowConsumptionOverflow) &&
!tx.IsL1MessageTx()):

```

```
    // Circuit capacity check: L2MessageTx row consumption too high, skip the
account.

```

```
    // This is also useful for skipping "problematic" L2MessageTxs.
    log.Trace("Circuit capacity limit reached for a single tx", "tx",
tx.Hash().String())

```

```
   // after `ErrTxRowConsumptionOverflow`, ccc might not revert updates

```

     // with this transaction so we cannot pack more transactions.

     circuitCapacityReached = true
     break loop

 case (errors.Is(err, circuitcapacitychecker.ErrUnknown) && !tx.IsL1MessageTx()):
     // Circuit capacity check: unknown circuit capacity checker error for
 L2MessageTx, skip the account
     log.Trace("Unknown circuit capacity checker error for L2MessageTx", "tx",
 tx.Hash().String())

     // after `ErrUnknown`, ccc might not revert updates associated
     // with this transaction so we cannot pack more transactions.

When this flag is set to `true`, no new transactions will be added even if there is room for
additional transactions in the block (figure 1.2).

```
 // Fill the block with all available pending transactions.
 pending := w.eth.TxPool().Pending(true)
 // Short circuit if there is no available pending transactions.
 // But if we disable empty precommit already, ignore it. Since
 // empty block is necessary to keep the liveness of the network.

Exploit Scenario
Eve, an attacker, sends an L2 transaction that uses `ecrecover` many times. The
transaction is provided to the mempool with enough gas to be the first L2 transaction in


Trail of Bits 13 Scroll l2geth Diff Review Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


the blockchain. Because this causes an error in the circuit checker, it prevents all other L2
transactions from being executed in this block.


Recommendations
Short term, implement a snapshotting mechanism in the circuit checker to roll back
unexpected changes made as a result of incorrect or incomplete computation.


Long term, analyze and document all impacts of error handling across the system to
ensure that these errors are handled gracefully. Additionally, clearly document all expected
invariants of how the system is expected to behave to ensure that in interactions with
other components, these invariants hold throughout the system.

2. Unused and dead code


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-L2GETH-2


Target: Throughout the code


Description
Due to the infrastructure setup of this network and the use of a single node clique setup,
this fork of `geth` contains a significant amount of unused logic. Continuing to maintain this
code can be problematic and may lead to issues.


The following are examples of unused and dead code:


  - Uncle blocks—with a single node clique network, there is no chance for uncle blocks
to exist, so all the logic that handles and interacts with uncle blocks can be dropped.


  - [Redundant logic around updating the L1 queue index](https://github.com/scroll-tech/go-ethereum/blob/d4597e369e4913b6f03fcf228fa59985420fce05/miner/worker.go#L707-L709)


  - [A redundant check on empty blocks in the](https://github.com/scroll-tech/go-ethereum/blob/d4597e369e4913b6f03fcf228fa59985420fce05/miner/worker.go#L1327-L1330) `[worker.go](https://github.com/scroll-tech/go-ethereum/blob/d4597e369e4913b6f03fcf228fa59985420fce05/miner/worker.go#L1327-L1330)` file


Recommendations
Short term, remove anything that is no longer relevant for the current `go-etheruem`
implementation and be sure to document all the changes to the codebase.


Long term, remove all unused code from the codebase.

**PUBLIC**


3. Lack of documentation


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Unexpected Behavior Finding ID: TOB-L2GETH-3


Target: `miner/worker.go`


Description
Certain areas of the codebase lack documentation, high-level descriptions, and examples,
which makes the contracts difficult to review and increases the likelihood of user mistakes.


Areas that would benefit from being expanded and clarified in code and documentation
include the following:


  - **Internals of the CCC** . Despite being treated as a black box, the code relies on
stateful changes made from `geth` calls. This suggests that the internal states of the
miner's work and the CCC overlap. The lack of documentation regarding these
states creates a lack of visibility in evaluating whether there are potential state
corruptions or unexpected behavior.


  - **Circumstances where transactions are skipped and how they are expected to**
**be handled.** During the course of the review, we attempted to reverse engineer the
intended behavior of transactions considered skipped by the CCC. The lack of
documentation in these areas results in unclear expectations for this code.


  - **Error handling standard throughout the system.** The codebase handles system
errors differently—in some cases, logging an error and continuing execution or
logging traces. Listing out all instances where errors are identified and documenting
how they are handled can help ensure that there is no unexpected behavior related
to error handling.


The documentation should include all expected properties and assumptions relevant to the
aforementioned aspects of the codebase.


Recommendations
Short term, review and properly document the aforementioned aspects of the codebase. In
addition to external documentation, NatSpec and inline code comments could help clarify
complexities.


Long term, consider writing a formal specification of the protocol.

## C. Code Quality Recommendations

The following recommendations are not associated with specific vulnerabilities. However,
they enhance code readability and may prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities in the
future.


**●** **Consider simplifying the switch case statements that check whether**
**transactions are L1 messages or not.** The current error handling in
`commitTransactions` makes the codebase hard to read.


**●** **Separate logic intended for production deployment from logic introduced for**
**testing purposes.** For example, the `worker.go` file contains functions and `if`
conditions for zero-period cliques or side-chain events, which are used only in
testing. Removing these from the core codebase would make the contracts
significantly more readable.


**●** **Fix the spelling error on the** **`ErrNonceTooHigh`** **log with the correct spelling of**
**`height`** **instead of** **`hight`** **.** Correct spelling ensures that expected system behavior
is clear.
