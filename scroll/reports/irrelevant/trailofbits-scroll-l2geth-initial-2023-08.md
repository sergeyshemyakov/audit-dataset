#### Test Coverage Disclaimer

All activities undertaken by Trail of Bits in association with this project were performed in
accordance with a statement of work and agreed upon project plan.


Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be
provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in
this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or
defects in the target system or codebase.


Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security
properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but
each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that
violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use
is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

## Executive Summary

#### Engagement Overview

Scroll engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of `l2geth`, Scroll’s fork of `go-ethereum`
(the Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol). The `l2geth` sequencer is an L2
transaction sequencer that collects L2 transactions, sequences them into blocks, and emits
tracing information that a set of circuits can use to generate zero-knowledge proofs.


A team of two consultants conducted the review from July 10 to July 21, 2023, for a total of
four engineer-weeks of effort. Our testing efforts focused on identifying any violated
invariants and reviewing the modifications made to the original `go-ethereum` code to
ensure that they do not introduce new security vulnerabilities. With full access to the
source code and documentation, we performed static and dynamic testing of `l2geth`,
using automated and manual processes.

#### Observations and Impact

Overall, we observed that in its current state, the codebase is relatively more immature
than expected at this point in the development life cycle. The changes to `go-ethereum`
contain many TODO statements, incorrectly handled errors, and MVP-specific configuration
settings that are not relevant to the production network.


`l2geth` currently operates using a single, centralized sequencer in Clique consensus mode;
however, using a single node in this consensus mode puts off-chain applications at risk of
double-spend attacks if the sequencer is compromised (TOB-L2GETH-3).

#### Recommendations

Based on the codebase maturity evaluation and findings identified during the security
review, Trail of Bits recommends that the Scroll team take the following steps before
deployment:


  - **Remediate the findings disclosed in this report.** Various identified issues may
lead to deviations from invariants established within the `l2geth` specification.
These findings should be addressed as part of direct remediation or as part of any
refactoring that may occur when addressing other recommendations.


  - **Expand the existing test suite.** The Scroll team should take the following actions to
expand the existing test suite: improve the test cases to cover a wider range of
inputs and edge cases, design negative tests to assess error handling, use mutation
testing to evaluate test effectiveness, create integration tests to validate component
interactions, and deploy the node in a testnet environment for end-to-end
validation. We anticipate that an expanded test suite will uncover additional issues


Trail of Bits 4 Scroll l2geth Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


related to insufficient data validation or error handling, similar to those disclosed in
this report.


  - **Resolve all TODO statements currently in** **`l2geth`** **.** All TODO statements must be
fully resolved before production deployment. TODO statements that cannot be
resolved before production deployment should be captured as tickets/GitHub issues
to ensure that they are prioritized and their risk is accounted for.


  - **Expand** **`l2geth`** **’s CI pipeline.** The Scroll team should run `l2geth` ’s full test suite in
the CI pipeline for all pull requests. In addition, Go static analysis tools should be
added to prevent common, easy-to-detect issues from being introduced into the
codebase. Recommended static analysis tools include `go vet`, `staticcheck`,
`ineffassign`, `errcheck`, `exportloopref`, and `gokart` .


  - **Generate invalid execution traces and attempt to prove them.** `l2geth` ’s
execution traces are consumed by the circuits to generate zero-knowledge proofs of
the execution, and if the trace is invalid or incorrect, the circuit should fail to
generate a proof. Scroll should consider using a fuzzer to generate invalid execution
traces to verify that the circuits will not generate a proof for an invalid trace.


  - **Generate random transactions and attempt to prove them.** Scroll should
generate random transactions, such as contract creation transactions and calls to
certain functions, and verify that the circuits always generate a valid proof.


  - **Create larger-scale testnet deployments and generate transactions on them.**
Scroll should invest in a larger-scale testnet deployment that uses randomly
submitted transactions, bridge operations, random starts and stops of the
sequencer, and follower sync nodes. A more effective testnet strategy can help
detect issues such as TOB-L2GETH-4, TOB-L2GETH-5, and TOB-L2GETH-6. Some
[existing tools such as tx-fuzz may be helpful for facilitating the described testnet.](https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/tx-fuzz)


Over the long term, Trail of Bits recommends that the Scroll team focus on the following
initiatives to increase `l2geth` ’s security maturity:


  - **Remove unused code from** **`l2geth`** **.** The `go-ethereum` fork weighs in at roughly
half a million lines of code and carries a large amount of technical debt. Much of this
code is not necessary for `l2geth` and will actively make `l2geth` harder to maintain
and audit as newer, more complex changes are made to the codebase. Scroll should
consider a large-scale refactor of the codebase to remove unnecessary features and
laser-focus the codebase on its targeted use case.


  - **Invest in additional sequencer and node clients** . Over the long term, Scroll
should invest in additional sequencer and node clients to help make the network
more robust. Multiple client implementations enable differential fuzzing and other

advanced testing techniques that can drastically improve the system’s security
assurance. If an investment in a multi-client ecosystem is planned, it should be
accompanied by a formal specification of the protocol to help identify the key
invariants and properties of the system, laying the groundwork for property-based
testing of each client.

## Project Goals

The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of Scroll’s `l2geth` .
Specifically, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list of questions:


  - Can a freshly synced follower node reach the same state root as the sequencer?


  - Is there any way to bypass L1 or L2 fees when submitting L1 or L2 transactions?


  - What kinds of new restrictions does `l2geth` apply to blocks and transactions, and
are those restrictions enforced during block production and sync?


  - Are there any downstream issues introduced by the use of Clique consensus for L2
transactions?


  - Is there a way to force the sequencer to replay an L1 transaction?


  - Does the L1 sync service correctly query the finalization condition for the L1 chain?


  - Do any new features in `l2geth` introduce nondeterminism that may lend itself to a
chain split or the inability to continue generating new blocks and advancing the
chain?


  - Were pre-existing providers within `go-ethereum` appropriately updated to handle
any new changes introduced within `l2geth` ?


  - Do any of the changes to `go-ethereum` impact the determinism properties of
consensus?

## Project Coverage

This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by
our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:


**●** **State account changes:** Two new fields, `PoseidonCodeHash` and `CodeSize`, were
added to the state account object in `l2geth` . We manually investigated the
implementation and use of these fields to ensure their correct functioning and
relevance within the state account structure.


**●** **State and storage trie replacement:** We manually reviewed the replacement of
the original Merkle Patricia Trie with zkTrie for both state and storage. We focused
on cross-comparing the two implementations to verify the correct integration of
zkTrie to maintain consistent data representation and retrieval.


**●** **EVM opcode modifications:** We manually reviewed changes to several EVM
opcodes, including `BLOCKHASH`, `COINBASE`, `DIFFICULTY`, `PREVRANDAO`, `BASEFEE`,
and `SELFDESTRUCT` to ensure accurate opcode behavior, appropriate handling of
fee calculation, and consistent functionality across the codebase. Changes to the
`DIFFICULTY` opcode were verified not to impact block headers.


**●** **Modifications to precompiled contracts:** We manually reviewed the modifications
made to the precompiled contracts `modexp` and `ecPairing` . Additionally, we
examined the disabling of the precompiled contracts `SHA2-256`, `RIPEMD-160`, and
`blake2f` . We checked for proper input restrictions and usage limitations for these
precompiled contracts to ensure the overall security and general correctness of
their implementation.


**●** **L1 and L2 transaction fee calculation:** `l2geth` adds an additional fee payment
mechanism to pay for L1 fees. We manually reviewed the L2 transaction fee
calculation, including L2 execution fees, L1 data fees, and the use of the
`L1GasPriceOracle` contract for the proper estimation of the L1 data fee based on
transaction data. We searched for methods by which a transaction may avoid paying
L1 or L2 fees, and we reviewed the various filtering mechanisms that `l2geth` uses
to rank transactions.


**●** **`L1MessageTx`** **:** We manually reviewed the introduction of a new transaction type,
`L1MessageTx`, for L1-initiated transactions. We reviewed the transaction payload
definition, its behavior, and the implementation of the new block validation rules
related to `L1MessageTx` transactions to ensure that the required front-of-block
placement and matching QueueIndex order are properly implemented.


Trail of Bits 10 Scroll l2geth Security Assessment

**PUBLIC**


**●** **Consensus:** We manually reviewed the adoption of the Clique consensus
mechanism to ensure that these changes were appropriately implemented and
aligned with the specification. We assembled a list of new consensus rules
introduced by `l2geth` and verified that `l2geth` checks for the rules during block
construction and sync. The following consensus rules were identified and verified
during block production and sync:


   - L1 transactions must be at the top of the block and must be contiguous.


   - L1 transactions must be ordered by queue index and be sequential to that of
the prior block.


   - The maximum initialization code size is enforced.


   - The maximum block payload size is enforced.


   - L2 transaction gas payment must match that defined by the `VerifyFee()`
function.


   - L1 transactions must be present on L1, and syncing nodes must not implicitly
trust the sequencer.


   - The maximum number of L2 transactions per block is enforced.


- **L1 sync service:** We reviewed the L1 sync service, a component used to identify L1
and sync transactions from the base chain. We reviewed this component for general
correctness and to ensure that it uses the correct definition of finality for a given
base chain.


- **General logic:** We reviewed the components in scope for a number of common
issues, using both manual and automated program analysis:


   - **Data manipulation:** We reviewed the data manipulation operations, such as
copying, updating, and storing the transactions and block data, for
correctness.


   - **Loop iterations:** We reviewed the loop iterations for correctness. We
checked the loop conditions, indices, and break conditions to ensure they are
bounded and accurate.


   - **Error handling:** We checked whether errors are handled properly and
appropriate actions are taken.

#### Coverage Limitations

Because of the time-boxed nature of testing work, it is common to encounter coverage
limitations. The following list outlines the coverage limitations of the engagement and
indicates system elements that may warrant further review:


  - [This review was conducted in the context of this pull request; any Geth code that is](https://github.com/scroll-tech/go-ethereum/compare/compare..scroll-tech:go-ethereum:audit-v1)
unrelated to the changes introduced in the `l2geth` fork falls outside the scope of
this review. The evaluation was specifically focused on the modifications and
additions made to the Geth codebase to implement the Scroll protocol and rollup
features. As a result, code changes or functionalities not directly linked to these
specific additions were not included in the review process.


  - Many Merkle Patricia Trie properties that applied to the original `go-ethereum`
implementation could not be verified in the zkTrie implementation, because the
code is in a library and was out of scope.


  - Mock implementations used in unit tests were not evaluated in depth to determine
test efficacy.


  - Risks of gas-related denial-of-service attacks were not fully evaluated during the
assessment.


  - Related Solidity smart contracts were out of scope.


  - The implications of a trustless sequencer were not examined in depth because
`l2geth` supports only centralized sequencing at this time.


  - The `go-ethereum` fork is a relatively large codebase, and given the time-boxed
nature of the audit and the deep changes made to its logic, there may be
undiscovered bugs that may impact the security or liveness properties of the
network.

## Codebase Maturity Evaluation

Trail of Bits uses a traffic-light protocol to provide each client with a clear understanding of
the areas in which its codebase is mature, immature, or underdeveloped. Deficiencies
identified here often stem from root causes within the software development life cycle that
should be addressed through standardization measures (e.g., the use of common libraries,
functions, or frameworks) or training and awareness programs.


**Category** **Summary** **Result**



Arithmetic We found that `l2geth` has issues with fully integrating
fee modifications across the codebase, specifically in
filtering/ordering code (TOB-L2GETH-1). At the time of
the audit, the test suite had little-to-no arithmetic tests
or negative tests for L1 transaction fees.


Auditing We found that the auditing and logging patterns used in
`l2geth` closely resemble those of existing logging
providers within `go-ethereum` . We identified no issues
with the pattern of logging. Additional logging should be
performed for increased verbosity, but for production,
logging was found to be sufficient.



Authentication /
Access Controls


Complexity
Management



No meaningful changes to `go-ethereum` ’s access
controls were made in `l2geth` .


`l2geth` builds on top of `go-ethereum`, a large and
varied codebase that carries a large amount of technical
debt. This technical debt makes it much harder to make
sweeping architectural changes to the software without
introducing hard-to-detect issues of varying severities
(TOB-L2GETH-1, TOB-L2GETH-4).


The technical debt carried over from `go-ethereum`
makes it harder to review the `l2geth` code and to
determine whether a specific code quirk reflects a
quality issue with `l2geth` or a workaround for a legacy
feature that `go-ethereum` maintains.


`l2geth` ’s changes also contain many unresolved TODO
statements and code quality issues likely stemming
from a fast development life cycle. Full inclusion of the
`go-ethereum` source code makes code atrophy from

Management



these changes much harder to detect against the
background of historical `go-ethereum` quirks.


No meaningful changes to `go-ethereum` ’s cryptography
or key management were made in `l2geth` . We
reviewed `l2geth` ’s changes to the Merkle Patricia Trie
only for code quality and high-level issues, as the core
implementation for the zkTrie was out of scope for this
review.



Decentralization `l2geth` runs using a centralized sequencer, which
represents a single point of failure. Using a single
sequencer with Clique consensus can expose off-chain
applications to double-spend attacks (TOB-L2GETH-3),
which at this time cannot be mitigated unless off-chain
applications manually query checkpoints on L1.


Documentation Scroll’s public documentation is relatively thorough for
an early-stage project and contains detailed information
about the changes made to `go-ethereum` ’s codebase;
however, other categories of documentation are
entirely missing:


          - Information on how to determine whether a
transaction on L2 is final (required for safe
exchange and bridge integration)


          - A specification detailing `l2geth` ’s modifications
in enough detail that a third-party developer
could modify an Ethereum client and join the
network as a follower


             - Some of this information is already
present in the documentation and
simply needs to be expanded.


          - Information on how to run a follower node



Transaction
Ordering Risks


Memory Safety
and Error



`l2geth` may have transaction-ordering risks due to how
L1 transactions are ordered in a block. We were unable
to examine these risks due to time constraints.

Handling `go-ethereum` code, we found that several issues stem
from `l2geth` ’s changes, including instances in which
`panic` is used instead of Go’s error management
system (TOB-L2GETH-4) and an instance in which no
error management is used at all—the program simply
dereferences a pointer (TOB-L2GETH-5).

Testing and

`l2geth` ’s modifications do not introduce any low-level
manipulation.


While the unit test coverage is decent, many of the tests
are inherited from `go-ethereum` and may not be
adequate to test the new features (even once they are
modified). Many findings could have been prevented
with a more comprehensive test suite (TOB-L2GETH-1,
TOB-L2GETH-7).


Multiple unit tests were not working at the time of the
review, but they have been fixed in a newer branch.

## Detailed Findings

1. Transaction pool fails to drop transactions that cannot afford L1 fees


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-L2GETH-1


Target: `core/types/transaction.go`


Description
`l2geth` defines two fees that must be paid for L2 transactions: an L2 fee and an L1 fee.
However, the code fails to account for L1 fees; as a result, transactions that cannot afford
the combined L1 and L2 fees may be included in a block rather than demoted, as intended.


The `transaction.go` file defines a `Cost()` function that returns the amount of ether that
a transaction consumes, as shown in figure 1.1. The current implementation of `Cost()`
does not account for L1 fees, causing other parts of the codebase to misjudge the balance
requirements to execute a transaction. The correct implementation of `Cost()` should
match the implementation of `VerifyFee()`, which correctly checks for L1 fees.

```
 // Cost returns gas * gasPrice + value.
 func (tx *Transaction) Cost() *big.Int {
     total := new(big.Int).Mul(tx.GasPrice(), new(big.Int).SetUint64(tx.Gas()))
     total.Add(total, tx.Value())
     return total
 }
```

_Figure 1.1: The_ _`Cost()`_ _function does not include L1 fees in its calculation._

_(_ _`[go-ethereum/core/types/transaction.go#318–323](https://github.com/scroll-tech/go-ethereum/blob/2dcc60a082ff89d1c57e497f23daad4823b2fdea/core/types/transaction.go#L318-L323)`_ _)_


Most notably, `Cost()` is consumed by the `tx_list.Filter()` function, which is used to
prune un-executable transactions (transactions that cannot afford the fees), as shown in
figure 1.2. The failure to account for L1 fees in `Cost()` could cause `tx_list.Filter()` to
fail to demote such transactions, causing them to be incorrectly included in the block.

```
 func (l *txList) Filter(costLimit *big.Int, gasLimit uint64) (types.Transactions,
 types.Transactions) {
     // If all transactions are below the threshold, short circuit
     if l.costcap.Cmp(costLimit) <= 0 && l.gascap <= gasLimit {
         return nil, nil
     }
     l.costcap = new(big.Int).Set(costLimit) // Lower the caps to the thresholds

```

```
     l.gascap = gasLimit

     // Filter out all the transactions above the account's funds
     removed := l.txs.Filter(func(tx *types.Transaction) bool {
         return tx.Gas() > gasLimit || tx.Cost().Cmp(costLimit) > 0
     })
```

_Figure 1.2:_ _`Filter()`_ _uses_ _`Cost()`_ _to determine which transactions to demote._

_(_ _`[go-ethereum/core/tx_list.go#332–343](https://github.com/scroll-tech/go-ethereum/blob/2dcc60a082ff89d1c57e497f23daad4823b2fdea/core/tx_list.go#L332-L343)`_ _)_
Exploit Scenario
A user creates an L2 transaction that can just barely afford the L1 and L2 fees in the next
upcoming block. Their transaction is delayed due to full blocks and is included in a future
block in which the L1 fees have risen. Their transaction reverts due to the increased L1 fees
instead of being ejected from the transaction pool.


Recommendations
Short term, refactor the `Cost()` function to account for L1 fees, as is done in the
`VerifyFee()` function; alternatively, have the transaction list structure use `VerifyFee()`
or a similar function instead of `Cost()` .


Long term, add additional tests to verify complex state transitions such as a transaction
becoming un-executable due to changes in L1 fees.

2. Multiple instances of unchecked errors


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-L2GETH-2


Targets: `trie/zkproof/writer.go`, `trie/sync.go`, `trie/proof.go`,
`trie/committer.go`, `trie/database.go`


Description
There are multiple instances of unchecked errors in the `l2geth` codebase, which could
lead to undefined behavior when errors are raised. One such unhandled error is shown in
figure 2.1. A comprehensive list of unchecked errors is provided in appendix C.

```
 if len(requests) == 0 && req.deps == 0 {
     s.commit(req)
 } else {
```

_Figure 2.1: The_ _`Sync.commit()`_ _function returns an error that is unhandled, which could lead_

_to invalid commitments or a frozen chain. (_ _`[go-ethereum/trie/sync.go#296–298](https://github.com/scroll-tech/go-ethereum/blob/2dcc60a082ff89d1c57e497f23daad4823b2fdea/trie/sync.go#L296-L298)`_ _)_


Unchecked errors also make the system vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks; they could
allow attackers to trigger `nil` dereference panics in the sequencer node.


Exploit Scenario
An attacker identifies a way to cause a zkTrie commitment to fail, allowing invalid data to be
silently committed by the sequencer.


Recommendations
Short term, add error checks to all functions that can emit Go errors.


Long term, add the tools `errcheck` and `ineffassign` to `l2geth` ’s build pipeline. These
tools can be used to detect errors and prevent builds containing unchecked errors from

3. Risk of double-spend attacks due to use of single-node Clique consensus
without finality API


Severity: **Medium** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Undefined Behavior Finding ID: TOB-L2GETH-3


Target: N/A


Description
`l2geth` [uses the proof-of-authority Clique consensus protocol, defined by EIP-255. This](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-225)
consensus type is not designed for single-node networks, and an attacker-controlled
sequencer node may produce multiple conflicting forks of the chain to facilitate
double-spend attacks.


The severity of this finding is compounded by the fact that there is no API for an end user
to determine whether their transaction has been finalized by L1, forcing L2 users to use
ineffective block/time delays to determine finality.


Clique consensus was originally designed as a replacement for proof-of-work consensus for
Ethereum testnets. It uses the same fork choice rule as Ethereum’s proof-of-work
consensus; the fork with the highest “difficulty” should be considered the canonical fork.
Clique consensus does not use proof-of-work and cannot update block difficulty using the
traditional calculation; instead, block difficulty may be one of two values:


  - “1” if the block was mined by the designated signer for the block height


  - “2” if the block was mined by a non-designated signer for the block height


This means that in a network with only one authorized signer, all of the blocks and forks
produced by the sequencer will have the same difficulty value, making it impossible for
syncing nodes to determine which fork is canonical at the given block height.


In a normal proof-of-work network, one of the proposed blocks will have a higher difficulty
value, causing syncing nodes to re-organize and drop the block with the lower difficulty
value. In a single-validator proof-of-authority network, neither block will be preferred, so
each syncing node will simply prefer the first block they received.


This finding is not unique to `l2geth` ; it will be endemic to all L2 systems that have only one
authorized sequencer.

Exploit Scenario
An attacker acquires control over `l2geth` ’s centralized sequencer node. The attacker
modifies the node to prove two forks: one fork containing a deposit transaction to a
centralized exchange, and one fork with no such deposit transaction. The attacker
publishes the first fork, and the centralized exchange picks up and processes the deposit
transaction. The attacker continues to produce blocks on the second private fork. Once the
exchange processes the deposit, the attacker stops generating blocks on the public fork,
generates an extra block to make the private fork longer than the public fork, then
publishes the private fork to cause a re-organization across syncing nodes. This attack must
be completed before the sequencer is required to publish a proof to L1.


Recommendations
Short term, add API methods and documentation to ensure that bridges and centralized
exchanges query only for transactions that have been proved and finalized on the L1
network.


Long term, decentralize the sequencer in such a way that a majority of sequencers must
collude in order to successfully execute a double-spend attack. This design should be
accompanied by a slashing mechanism to penalize sequencers that sign conflicting blocks.

4. Improper use of panic


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Medium**


Type: Denial of Service Finding ID: TOB-L2GETH-4


Target: Various areas of the codebase


Description
`l2geth` overuses Go’s `panic` mechanism in lieu of Go’s built-in error propagation system,
introducing opportunities for denial of service.


Go has two primary methods through which errors can be reported or propagated up the
call stack: the `panic` method and Go errors. The use of `panic` is not recommended, as it is
unrecoverable: when an operation panics, the Go program is terminated and must be
restarted. The use of `panic` creates a denial-of-service vector that is especially applicable
to a centralized sequencer, as a restart of the sequencer would effectively halt the L2
network until the sequencer recovers.


Some example uses of `panic` are presented in figures 4.1 to 4.3. These do not represent an
exhaustive list of `panic` statements in the codebase, and the Scroll team should investigate
each use of `panic` in its modified code to verify whether it truly represents an
unrecoverable error.

Exploit Scenario
An attacker identifies an error path that terminates with a panic that can be triggered by a
malformed RPC request or proof payload. The attacker leverages this issue to either
disrupt the sequencer’s operation or prevent follower/syncing nodes from operating
properly.


Recommendations
Short term, review all uses of `panic` that have been introduced by Scroll’s changes to
`go-ethereum` . Ensure that these uses of `panic` truly represent unrecoverable errors, and
if not, add error handling logic to recover from the errors.


Long term, annotate all valid uses of `panic` with explanations for why the errors are
unrecoverable and, if applicable, how to prevent the unrecoverable conditions from being
triggered. `l2geth` ’s code review process must also be updated to verify that this
documentation exists for new uses of `panic` that are introduced later.

5. Risk of panic from nil dereference due to flawed error reporting in
addressToKey


Severity: **Informational** Difficulty: **N/A**


Type: Error Reporting Finding ID: TOB-L2GETH-5


Target: `trie/zkproof/writer.go`


Description
The `addressToKey` function, shown in figure 5.1, returns a `nil` pointer instead of a Go
error when an error is returned by the `preImage.Hash()` function, which will cause a `nil`
dereference panic in the `NewZkTrieProofWriter` function, as shown in figure 5.2.


If the error generated by `preImage.Hash()` is unrecoverable, the `addressToKey` function
should panic instead of silently returning a `nil` pointer.

```
 func addressToKey(addr common.Address) *zkt.Hash {
     var preImage zkt.Byte32
     copy(preImage[:], addr.Bytes())

6. Risk of transaction pool admission denial of service


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **Low**


Type: Denial of Service Finding ID: TOB-L2GETH-6


Target: `core/tx_pool.go`


Description
`l2geth` ’s changes to the transaction pool include an ECDSA recovery operation at the
beginning of the pool’s transaction validation logic, introducing a denial-of-service vector:
an attacker could generate invalid transactions to exhaust the sequencer’s resources.


`l2geth` adds an L1 fee that all L2 transactions must pay. To verify that an L2 transaction
can afford the L1 fee, the transaction pool calls `fees.VerifyFee()`, as shown in figure
6.1. `VerifyFee()` performs an ECDSA recovery operation to determine the account that
will pay the L1 fee, as shown in figure 6.2.


ECDSA key recovery is an expensive operation that should be executed as late in the
transaction validation process as possible in order to reduce the impact of denial-of-service
attacks.


```
func (pool *TxPool) add(tx *types.Transaction, local bool) (replaced bool, err
error) {

```

```
// If the transaction is already known, discard it
hash := tx.Hash()
if pool.all.Get(hash) != nil {

```

```
        log.Trace("Discarding already known transaction", "hash", hash)
        knownTxMeter.Mark(1)
        return false, ErrAlreadyKnown
    }
    // Make the local flag. If it's from local source or it's from the network
but

```

```
    // the sender is marked as local previously, treat it as the local
transaction.
    isLocal := local || pool.locals.containsTx(tx)

    if pool.chainconfig.Scroll.FeeVaultEnabled() {
        if err := fees.VerifyFee(pool.signer, tx, pool.currentState); err !=
nil {

Exploit Scenario
An attacker generates a denial-of-service attack against the sequencer by submitting
extraordinarily large transactions. Because ECDSA recovery is a CPU-intensive operation
and is executed before the transaction size is checked, the attacker is able to exhaust the
memory resources of the sequencer.


Recommendations
Short term, modify the code to check for L1 fees in the `TxPool.validateTx()` function
immediately after that function calls `types.Sender()` . This will ensure that other, less
expensive-to-check validations are performed before the ECDSA signature is recovered.


Long term, exercise caution when making changes to code paths that validate information
received from public sources or gossip. For changes to the transaction pool, a good general
rule of thumb is to validate transaction criteria in the following order:


1. Simple, in-memory criteria that do not require disk reads or data manipulation


2. Criteria that require simple, in-memory manipulations of the data such as checks of
the transaction size


3. Criteria that require an in-memory state trie to be checked


4. ECDSA recovery operations


5. Criteria that require an on-disk state trie to be checked


However, note that sometimes these criteria must be checked out of order; for example,
the ECDSA recovery operation to identify the origin account may need to be performed
before the state trie is checked to determine whether the account can afford the
transaction.

7. Syncing nodes fail to check consensus rule for L1 message count


Severity: **Low** Difficulty: **High**


Type: Data Validation Finding ID: TOB-L2GETH-7


Target: `core/block_validator.go`


Description
`l2geth` adds a consensus rule requiring that there be no more than
`L1Config.NumL1MessagesPerBlock` number of L1 messages per L2 block. This rule is
checked by the sequencer when building new blocks but is not checked by syncing nodes
through the `ValidateL1Messages` function, as shown in figure 7.1.

```
 // TODO: consider adding a rule to enforce L1Config.NumL1MessagesPerBlock.
 // If there are L1 messages available, sequencer nodes should include them.
 // However, this is hard to enforce as different nodes might have different views of
 L1.
```

_Figure 7.1: The_ _`ValidateL1Messages`_ _function does not check the_ _`NumL1MessagesPerBlock`_

_restriction. (_ _`[go-ethereum/core/block_validator.go#145–147](https://github.com/scroll-tech/go-ethereum/blob/a677ee3ccf91a6918ef77fc6f9931ae2a5ff71d1/core/block_validator.go#L143-L149)`_ _)_


The TODO comment shown in the figure expresses a concern that syncing nodes cannot
enforce `NumL1MessagesPerBlock` due to the different view of L1 that the nodes may
have; however, this issue does not prevent syncing nodes from simply checking the
number of L1 messages included in the block.


Exploit Scenario
A malicious sequencer ignores the `NumL1MessagesPerBlock` restriction while
constructing a block, thus bypassing the consensus rules. Follower nodes consider the
block to be valid even though the consensus rule is violated.


Recommendations
Short term, add a check to `ValidateL1Messages` to check the maximum number of L1
messages per block restriction.


Long term, document and check all changes to the system’s consensus rules to ensure that
both nodes that construct blocks and nodes that sync blocks check the consensus rules.
This includes having syncing nodes check whether an L1 transaction actually exists on the
L1, a concern expressed in comments further up in the `ValidateL1Messages` function.

**●** **Remove redundant code.** Clean up the redundant code related to handling uncle
blocks and forks, as the codebase does not recognize or produce uncle blocks.
Removing this unnecessary functionality will simplify the code, making it easier to
understand and maintain.


  - **Address TODO statements or create tickets for them.** TODO statements should
remain in a codebase only while the codebase is in a pre-release state. Address
TODO statements that can be addressed immediately; for those that cannot be
addressed before production deployment, create tickets to ensure that they are
prioritized.


  - **Use feature flags to control network behavior instead of using reflection or**
**magic hashes.** Some features in `l2geth` use reflection or the presence of a specific
hash in a database to determine whether certain features are enabled, as in the
`VerifyProof` function, shown in figure D.3. Feature flags provide a better, more
unified interface to enable or disable specific features or functionality. If a function

needs to operate in multiple, simultaneous modes, an encapsulating function
should be used to make it clear that the behavior is not specific to a network
feature.

```
func VerifyProof(rootHash common.Hash, key []byte, proofDb ethdb.KeyValueReader)
(value []byte, err error) {

    // test the type of proof (for trie or SMT)
    if buf, _ := proofDb.Get(magicHash); buf != nil {
        return VerifyProofSMT(rootHash, key, proofDb)
    }

    key = keybytesToHex(key)
    wantHash := rootHash
    for i := 0; ; i++ {
